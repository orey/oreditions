# Remembering My Friend

My Friend<br />
The Universe is pending!<br />
Suddenly only my heart beats!<br />
Then my ears are overflowed by all the heart's beats!<br />
All the life that You're breathing through us!

The old guy walks along the beach<br />
The mountains away with gray clouds<br />
The waves drawing into the wet sand<br />
My feet touch the cold water

The Beloved told me:<br />
"You may fusion in me<br />
I condemned you to be individuals<br />
You must become yourself<br />
To worship me truly."

The path to oneself is full of obstacles<br />
Organizations make you drift away from what you really are<br />
Most gurus are not so trustable<br />
Too many partners are not close enough from You<br />
Too few human beings are thrilled when hearing one of Your names!<br />
