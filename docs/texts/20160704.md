# Prayer To The Friend

My Friend, You take a form dear to our heart to come and visit us!<br />
We cannot dress You with other clothes!<br />
Come and fire my heart!

My Lord!<br />
Feeling You is no ideology, not thinking!<br />
Seeing You is no madness!<br />
Praying You is all my breath!<br />
Loving You is my deep secret!

Dear Friend!<br />
You play with men!<br />
Scholars may understand but they may not feel You while You are here!<br />
Matter bounds so many of us!<br />
Forgive!

In the whirling move of the night<br />
-You are!<br />
In the love look of the child for his mother<br />
-You are!<br />
In the chill that runs over me<br />
-You are!

Day life makes us believe in our ego<br />
Day life pushes in the social battlefield<br />
In front of You, fake ego vanishes<br />
And Your reflection stays<br />

We can never loose the Quran!<br />
It flows from eternity<br />
Like a mirror it talks to us<br />
And shows us our misery<br />
Outside of You

Some say saints are from the past<br />
Some say saints have long beard<br />
Some say the digital world doesn't need God<br />
Open some eyes<br />
My dear Friend!

Even if screens bring everything<br />
Even if we can write on keyboards<br />
Even if we are connected

My Lord<br />
Make us hand write<br />
And read<br />
Real books!

My Friend<br />
Some phenomenon talk to our hearts while some don't<br />
In Your hands, we are just strings You play unto<br />
Various and praying You!
