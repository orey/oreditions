# You Are Close

My Lord, show me the path to the heart of my heart!<br />
Lead me to the core of the truth!<br />
Burn me with the lava of love!

Beloved!<br />
I cannot loose You!<br />
I cannot forget You!<br />
I cannot be told to forget You!<br />
I cannot be without You!<br />
I is in You!

Beloved!<br />
Some of us made the path to you so complicated that Your breath is unreachable!<br />
I pray for the distant to get closer!<br />
Closer to You

Oh my Lord!<br />
You are the Judge!<br />
And anyone disobbeying You will discover it!

Truth in my mind!<br />
Truth in my heart!<br />
Love in my heart!<br />
Love in my love!<br />
Beloved in the love of my love!

Oh! Beloved!<br />
You love anyone and anything!<br />
And Your flow of love make my heart burst!
