# What's Left

Beyond ideology,<br />
Beyond matter and money,<br />
Beyond what you think you know,<br />
Beyond what some call religion,<br />
There You are my Friend!

Beloved!<br />
Tomorrow I won't be anymore!<br />
My ashes will feed the dirt that will feed the grass that will feed the sheep!<br />
But, am I really now?

-

In the cold morning of winter, in the windy light of dawn, You are, Beloved!

-

Exiled in a cold country, You are what's left, Beloved!

When love is on our mind, You power it!

Beloved!<br />
Your beauty reflects in the eyes of Your children!

-

Beloved! You are the heart of my heart!

-

Beloved! You are the heart of my heart!
