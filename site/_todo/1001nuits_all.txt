    My Friend, some say nothing is important. Love is, Beloved, and every love we feel is an echo of Your love! Make us love always, Dearest! Feb 26, 2012
    My Lord, light our inner light with a reflection of Your face! Be there for us, Beloved! And forgive! Feb 26, 2012
    My Friend, You help us understand your message and not getting lost even if Your ways can be unpredictable! Feb 11, 2012
    O Lord! You did not make things easy! Ego fighting is a hard path going through the recollection of Your names! Jan 19, 2012
    Some people think they don't believe in You! Zeitun laughs! Their ego just hides the Truth to them! Jan 19, 2012
    If You forgive, who am I not to forgive? But as a human, my forgiveness can imply isolation whereas You always stay with all of us! Jan 19, 2012
    Beloved! Your love is all around us, poor children of Yours! You mercyfully let us play with our egos! Only the saints are looking at You! Jan 19, 2012
    Listen! Listen! Listen and you know what? Listen! Listen! Shut up and listen! Clear your head and listen! If only we could listen for Him! Jan 19, 2012
    When people are deeply lost in their ego, you cannot but remain silent. Jan 19, 2012
    Some of us are lost in their minds! Some of us are losts in ideas! Some of us are lost in their ego! Be lost in the Beloved! Dance with Him! Jan 19, 2012
    Ideas shouldn't be your guru! Ego shouldn't be your guru! Politics or carreer shouldn't be your guru! Life is your first guru if you listen! Jan 19, 2012
    We are so fragile in ourselves, in our foundations, too attached to routine, that so many of us, thinking they are harassed, harass back. Jan 11, 2012
    When a person around you shows a strange reaction to something, you should ask yourself what is he or she afraid about. Jan 11, 2012
    Beloved! You are here! In the eternal present, you are inside the moment! Your breath makes my self vanish in tears! Jan 07, 2012
    If we can extinct fear in ourselves, you can get peace. Jan 07, 2012
    Freud said a lot about unconscious. But sex is not driving the whole of it whereas fear does. Jan 07, 2012
    May Your lights and wisdom and love and mercy be with us for this new year, Beloved, and may we be ready in our hearts to come close to You! Jan 01, 2012
    Happy new year to all of us, the seekers of His face, whether we are Muslim, Jew, Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist, or other faith! Jan 01, 2012
    Happy new year to all of you and may 2012 be the year when we all get closer to the Beloved! Jan 01, 2012
    @Caribou57 oui ! Que nous nous montrions dignes d'être les mourides d'aujourd'hui suivant les pas des soufis d'hier vers le Bien-Aimé ! Jan 01, 2012
    Happy new year to all! Let 2012 be the year when your heart gets nearer to the Beloved! Jan 01, 2012
    @oiseau_twitteur oui, ma chère amie, j'ai tellement soif de Lui ! Toi aussi, ton coeur pleure quand Il se cache ! Bien-Aimé, reviens ! Dec 25, 2011
    Merry Christmas for the seekers! You may not be religious persons but if you sincerily seek, you will enter one of the many religious paths! Dec 25, 2011
    Beloved, I want more than child stories! I want more than small challenges! I want more than the distant sound of Your voice! Lord, help me! Dec 25, 2011
    Merry Christmas for Christians and Merry day for Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddists, Taoists, etc., and atheists! May His light burn your soul! Dec 25, 2011
    Merry Christmas for all the Christians and for all the Christians by tradition! Dec 25, 2011
    Spend more time of your life meditating on good feeling zones to find the path to peaceful zones. Those are the doorstep to You, my Friend! Dec 23, 2011
    In our minds, there are zones of feelings. We use to spend far too much time in dark zones because we think this will solve our problems. Dec 23, 2011
    French people often would like to understand the world without religion. This is as if they were to understand love by reading books only. Dec 23, 2011
    We have become so afraid of each others, so closed behind our physical and mental walls. So many of us are now craving for You, my Friend! Dec 23, 2011
    @oiseau_twitteur Que sa lumière nous accompagne ! Combien d'entre nous sont des égarés nécessitant ce Rappel ! Dec 23, 2011
    So many of us live in confusion, my Friend, and misled is the one who is not guided! Guide us to the light, Lord! Dec 18, 2011
    Why, my Lord, are we incapable of learning from other's experiences? For we can teach geometry but only You can fire the soul up! Dec 08, 2011
    My Friend, You made us so small, so narrow-minded, so stupid, so incapable of detecting patterns in our mind! Unblind us to Your worship! Dec 08, 2011
    There is more behind dogma than it appears at first. But few of us can dig to the roots of dogma to find the hidden gems. Dec 03, 2011
    A blind man cannot guide. Find a guide who is not spiritually blind. Dec 03, 2011
    For intellectual people, life is a maze. For guided ones, life is a path. For saints, life is a prayer. For prophets, life is a mission. Dec 03, 2011
    When we fight for truth, we have to be aware of not using truth to hurt. If truth cannot but be used to hurt, let us take the silent path. Oct 30, 2011
    My Friend! We never know when You will call us back! Let us have a prayer for those who departed recently! Oct 24, 2011
    @oiseau_twitteur Oui, c'est le coeur qui chante quand Il est là! Oct 23, 2011
    O Lord, You have given me so much that even if I were to pray you every second of my remaining life, I would not be worth kissing your feet! Oct 23, 2011
    It requires wisdom to see the bad people. Oct 13, 2011
    The paths You choose for us, dearest Friend, are not so obvious but they are what is and they bear some meaning that we shall understand. Oct 13, 2011
    Listen to the voice of the Beloved through the words coming to you! Oct 13, 2011
    What is our ego before the Beloved? Ashes! Oct 13, 2011
    It takes some wisdom to understand religious writings. At least, the wisdom of reading with the heart and not the mind! Oct 13, 2011
    We would meet Jesus himself. Would we be on the right side? Would we love him? Follow the lead of the Beloved! Oct 08, 2011
    We talk about wise men but would we be able to recognize one? Above all if he does not show the usual sign like grey hair, special clothes. Oct 08, 2011
    The Beloved teach us something every second. That's why life is the passion for Him! Our hearts do not listen very often but they should! Oct 08, 2011
    You, my Lord, are so Great that I feel dirty just to mention one of Your names! Oct 03, 2011
    Oh, my Friend, You are so Marvellous! I deeply love Thou! Oct 03, 2011
    Praise the Beloved for He is responsible for everything! Oct 03, 2011
    Discovering religion in our heart is like being born again! Oct 02, 2011
    Every woman and man seeking to go further short term knowledge and who discovers religion will be fascinated! Oct 02, 2011
    Our society pushes for short term memory of short term information. We have to resist to enter the path of the Beloved! Oct 01, 2011
    Beloved! You gave me so much! How can simply still I be occupied by something else than praying You? Sep 19, 2011
    Truth is the path of the Beloved and so is the silence! Sep 15, 2011
    Each set of words can be interpreted in complex dividing theories. Don't dig into words! Don't build concepts! Love and pray! Sep 12, 2011
    When we fear, we fail. When we fear, we miss. Be a fearless mind and go dance with the Friend! Sep 03, 2011
    We fear too much about matter, about ourselves, about the rules we should follow. Drop the fear and have eternal faith in the Beloved! Sep 03, 2011
    Fear weaves strange webs. Fearing to act, up to not acting, can be much worse that acting. Fear is creating bad situations! Sep 03, 2011
    Creation. Preservation. Destruction. These are the forces that You, my Friend, show us in matter. My soul eternally bends before You! Sep 02, 2011
    When things are unbalanced, You balance them. When things are balanced, You unbalance them. This is a facet of Your dance! Sep 02, 2011
    @zumouruda oui, il nous faut persévérer lorsque nos soucis nous masquent Sa présence. Le Rappel est aussi le Retour car Il revient toujours! Sep 02, 2011
    O Dearest Friend! Your law of causes and consequences emprisons us in our egotic actions! Show us how to avoid getting trapped in the web! Sep 02, 2011
    Ramadan mubarak to all of you and let the Beloved guide your steps! Aug 01, 2011

    After the game. http://t.co/foYFsHQ Jul 30, 2011
    Don't get lost in the maze of intellectual paths! Follow the beacon of Love! Jul 29, 2011
    I met an old man at the end of his life. No lies, no complexity and no regrets made him as light as a white bird flying to the other world. Jul 28, 2011
    @zumouruda nous devons garder cette âme d'éternels amoureux ! La tristesse vient quand nous nous éloignons de Lui, mais Il revient toujours! Jul 28, 2011
    Some of us seem too intelligent to flirt on Twitter! Beloved, have mercy on them because they must feel really lonely inside! Jul 27, 2011
    Some of us are dreaming about meeting new people on Twitter! Beware not to be naive! Beware not to project! Jul 27, 2011
    When we try to control, we create our own suffering. When we let the plant grow, we're often satisfied with its fruits! Jul 27, 2011
    When we make things happen, we are a reflection of a reflection of a reflection of Your will! Jul 27, 2011
    There is no loneliness with You! Jul 27, 2011
    We can be alone and focused upon ourselves, but we'd rather be alone focusing upon the Beloved! Jul 27, 2011
    In the present time, in this very moment that our mind so easily forgets by projecting into future is Your presence, my beloved Friend! Jul 27, 2011
    Prophets and saints are beyond the law of causes and consequences. They are intense reflections of the Primary Cause! Jul 27, 2011
    The law of causes and consequences is implacable. At the same time, it provides equilibrium and renewal by regulating matter. Jul 27, 2011
    I was a writer: I cannot write! I was a composer: I cannot compose! I was a poet: I lost my words! Since I met You, matter does not matter! Jul 26, 2011
    Oh, living with You is such a discovery, such a travel! Often, You disappear because I am not attentive enough! Come back and fill my cup! Jul 26, 2011
    Are we really satisfied of investing all our energy in matter? Are we fulfilled? Some of us may but most aren't! And You know it, my Friend! Jul 26, 2011
    Beloved! You make me suffer! But I know you want me near! Jul 24, 2011
    Following the path of truth means showing an huge patience with people. Without patience, truth hurts whereas with it, it is wisdom. Jul 22, 2011
    When you progress in the path of truth, you have to take the Beloved as a guide! Or you will hurt people around you. And this isn't truth! Jul 22, 2011
    We so often refuse to see the truth in front of us. We would like to hide it behind nice feelings and behaviors. But truth is. Jul 22, 2011
    RT @IslamicThinking: The most grateful of people to Allaah are those who are most grateful to other people. #islam #wisdom #gratitude Jul 22, 2011
    On top of having nothing, Beloved, I owe You everything! The very love I feel for You is my bottomless pit of debt! Jul 22, 2011
    @zumouruda C'est l'Ami qui parle ! Jul 22, 2011
    @zumouruda Mieux vaudrait dire que l'on a rencontré le Bien-Aimé ou que l'on ne L'a pas encore rencontré ! Jul 22, 2011
    My Lord, You made our body a mystery for us, a mystery to unveil! Unveiling it is finding the link to Your presence in the eternal present! Jul 21, 2011
    Beloved, guide us for we are lost, all of us at certain degrees except saints and prophets! Bless the ones that guide even imperfectly! Jul 21, 2011
    @zumouruda la prière nous change car elle met l'ego de côté. Ainsi, sans ego, nous pouvons accomplir le destin qu'il nous réserve :) Jul 21, 2011
    Don't be sure of anything, never! It cannot be done? Do it! It is too complicated? Simplify it! Noone ever make it happened? Make it happen! Jul 21, 2011
    Even if every one of us will face Him one day, some of us want to face him sooner! Jul 20, 2011
    Hafiz, I could thank you all night long for your poetry! But shouldn't I thank the Beloved for you and Him are just one! Jul 20, 2011
    My Friend! You are here! In the moment! My hair is up! You gave me goose-flesh while hearing the sound of Your eternal presence! Jul 20, 2011
    Illusion is a labyrinth. Only Your guidance can prevent us from loosing ourselves! Only You and Your qutb! Jul 19, 2011
    Beloved! Let the sun shine on the one of us that remember You! And let the sun shine on tge hearts of all the ones that are suffering! Jul 18, 2011
    Loving You is loving us! Jul 18, 2011
    I will never be able to repay all the good that came to me from people that I know or don't know! Lord, let me pay my debt to You! Jul 18, 2011
    The perfume of this rose is a path to You, dearest Friend! http://t.co/gnHtq8G Jul 18, 2011
    My Friend! Light my heart as dry wood! Light my head to make peace of mind! Light my love for all beings! Jul 18, 2011
    You! Sister and brother! You love the Lord as a Friend, a Father or a Mother! We are one in that ocean of love! Jul 18, 2011
    Oh lovers! Rejoice for He is here all around! Inside and Outside! Our friendship in Him goes beyond any blood or tribe or nation! Jul 18, 2011
    Oh lovers! May you all enter the tavern for us to cry jointly of joy for our Friend has come tonight! Jul 18, 2011
    @zumouruda في عيون محبي الصور هي من الحبيب! Jul 18, 2011
    Beloved! Your Love brings Truth! Truth brings knowledge! Knowledge brings sight! Sight brings silence, understanding, love and mercy! Jul 17, 2011
    We are all tied by God's will. When our ego steps back, we can see the interlinks and get a glimpse in Reality beyond the web of actions. Jul 17, 2011
    Beloved! I am ashes scattered by Your breath when You set the love fire in me! Have mercy on all the ones that suffer! Jul 17, 2011
    Seek the Beloved with one eye filled with love and one eye filled with truth! Jul 17, 2011
    We want novelty because our mind craves for new matter to crunch. Religion is no novelty and its deepness unveils as we go on the path! Jul 17, 2011
    @zumouruda oui, c'est sûr. C'est comme lire le Coran comme s'il était révélé à nous-même. C'est voir le Bien-Aimé dans ce qui nous entoure ! Jul 17, 2011
    Our ego is like a moray eel, always waiting to strike us when unexpected. That's why remembering You, my Friend, is so crucial. Jul 16, 2011
    Beloved, Truth and Love are two of Your marvellous names! Jul 14, 2011
    Wisdom begins by truth. Jul 14, 2011
    Listen to the words of truth of the Friend that come to us, just for us, through the mouth of other people. Jul 14, 2011

    My Lord, the infinity of Your blessing is so fabulous that I sometimes forget about physical bodies! Jul 08, 2011
    Beloved! We are puppets that believe that we can go on our ways! But we all follow the web of causes and consequences - except the saints! Jul 08, 2011
    My Friend, please give a rest to the poor hearts in pain, for the ones who show the pain and the ones who hide it! Jul 08, 2011
    Extreme weakness makes me nearer to You, my Friend. Jul 08, 2011

    When we are in search for a saint, we should look at the reflection of the Beloved upon our own heart! Apr 30, 2011
    When love is pouring out of your heart for all living things, don't take it personal! The Friend opened your heart! Apr 30, 2011
    May the Beloved be with us all! May You, my Friend, protect us and lead us to Your ocean of Love! Apr 29, 2011
    Some of us are meant to be travellers! They will keep on moving until they reach the shore of the Beloved! Isn't it @zumouruda? Apr 29, 2011
    Each one has a path and this path crosses the path of other persons! Be open to encounters for we are the best that can occur to each other! Apr 29, 2011

    Your breath is the essence of Life! Your presence is Mercy! The dikhr is Your song! Lord, make me remember You always! Apr 29, 2011
    Beloved, You made us from clay and we will return to dust! Let us pray and meditate on Your Order! Apr 29, 2011
    In joy, You are. In sorrow, You are. In truth You are. In lies, You are also. You are the opposites made One and also beyond manifestation! Apr 29, 2011
    My Friend, You tell Your name to your servants! Apr 29, 2011
    I see intentions within me and within others. When we have no intention, when we fast of intentions, then there is room for You, my Friend! Apr 21, 2011
    We are so often in selling mode. Selling out our opinions our method for happiness, our religion, our beliefs. Let's not sell anymore! Apr 21, 2011
    Very often, we are closed because we are in fear. Sometimes, some of us realize the closure feeds the fear instead of protecting from it. Apr 20, 2011
    I am a sinner! How could I be a master? I am a human! How could I be a saint? I am a lover! How could I be? Apr 18, 2011
    We should pray and pray and pray and meditate, meditate and meditate. For there are no better things to do in the eternal now! Apr 18, 2011
    Some would like to be alive, others dead! I wish nothing, Beloved, except a burning glance of your sight once in a while! Apr 18, 2011
    I wish you could feel this river of love floating to the air! Apr 18, 2011
    My problem: my ego; my Master is living in the sunny part of my house. Right in the heart! Apr 18, 2011
    I wish my love could reach the painful hearts and ease their pain! I wish my ear could listen to the forgotten and ease their inward burden! Apr 18, 2011
    Lord, dance amongst the stars! Bring peace and rest to the hurted hearts! Teach them to crave for Your lotus feet! Apr 18, 2011

    Oh Lord! You laugh while dancing with the worlds! Oh Beloved! Your circles are burning my soul in love! Apr 18, 2011
    Material concerns and pain make people so suspicious! We must open our heart to You in order to let you the room! Apr 18, 2011
    You decide everything! You rule everything! We are but toys in Your invisible hands! Beloved, play on us the music of Love! Apr 18, 2011
    Lord, how pretentious it is to think we are the author of our actions! And how pretentious it is to think we just are! Apr 18, 2011
    Beloved, my days are filled with your breath! Sometimes, I see the web of actions and reactions and I go as the flow You make! Apr 17, 2011
    Cold nights went back after hot days. Our hearts are following the same rythms, Beloved! Apr 17, 2011
    We spent so much energy building inward lies that we got attached to them through our ego! My Friend, help me overwhelm my ego veil! Apr 13, 2011
    We are so often so pathetic, not being able to speak truely, about things and mostly about ourselves! Apr 13, 2011
    We have to know our self just for the love of the Beloved! Then, when we know, the inward space is suddenly full of Him! Apr 13, 2011
    Words vanish with the "I". There is only You. Apr 08, 2011
    What is "I"? Apr 08, 2011
    There is equilibrium in matter, in destiny, in illusion. My Friend, beyond that lies the contact with You! Apr 08, 2011
    Words are so vain before You! Words are so small, so far from what I feel in Your presence! Apr 08, 2011
    @zumouruda yes! Some are following the north, others south, west or east. But the Beloved is the pole of our heart in all directions! Apr 08, 2011
    There are material things that pass. There are Your things that last and call for meditation. Apr 07, 2011
    I cannot get intoxicated with You, Beloved, even if the wine You serve is overwhelming me with love! Apr 07, 2011
    Lord! The mazes of Your will are so delicious! Apr 07, 2011
    We are not sufficiently opened to the unexpected which occurs all the time. Facing it, we must live it. And not represent it. Apr 07, 2011
    The path to You, my Friend, is always renewed because no second is like a past one in the wind of Your mercy! Apr 07, 2011
    The path to the Beloved is not simple nor it is generic! You know what I mean, my Friend! Mar 12, 2011
    Religion is the greatest gift the Beloved gave to humanity. Let us not make it dogma fights and hatred because that is not religion. Mar 12, 2011
    We should meditate and pray more than we speak. Mar 11, 2011
    Attachment is power upon ourselves of people, things or ideas. Be attached to nothing except to the Beloved! Mar 11, 2011
    Sometimes, things get right by themselves provided good deeds are done and no feeling is attached to way things go. Mar 11, 2011
    @zumouruda nous utilisons tous un ou plusieurs masques pour nous protéger. Mais cette protection coûte parfois plus qu'elle ne rapporte... Feb 21, 2011
    Somewhere, deep inside me is a secret! This secret is the love for the Beloved, a love that looks like boiling lava turning me to ashes! Feb 19, 2011
    Religion is my heart, my taste, my look, my ear, my breath, my mind! Religion is being with You, Beloved! Feb 19, 2011
    Contempt brings hate and hate brings death. Why despising so much in the first place those who are different from us? Feb 18, 2011
    Knowledge comes always through the Beloved! That's why we must not consider knowledge as our property but more something to give. Feb 18, 2011
    When we listen to life, it talks to us. Beyond are the words of the prophets and beyond is Your breath, my Friend! Feb 18, 2011
    Who are we to criticize one man's path to the Friend? Who are we to mock? Who are we to say that path is not the right one? Feb 15, 2011
    Ideologies are idols - without the spiritual aspect. Feb 15, 2011
    Beloved, look what the intellect did to manhood! Whereas this tool can produce marvelous machines, so many people use it to worship ideas! Feb 15, 2011
    Seeing the other as different from me is division which is Shaytan's vision. Such position cannot be seriously held by religious scholars! Feb 15, 2011
    Racism or religious antagonism are based on the fact that the "other" is different and bad. But the other is us! There are no others but us! Feb 15, 2011
    India always was the heart of Earth spirituality. This is a hard responsibility to cope with! Pray for India to shine again! Feb 15, 2011
    Extremism is bad in religion but also in politics, in science, in art and so on and so forth. Extremism is the expression of the ego. Feb 15, 2011
    Men are in conflict when they confront ideas. They should stick to share the love of the Friend! Feb 15, 2011
    Sometimes, we feel the real void of ego attachments. That's the path to You, Beloved! Feb 15, 2011
    Our ego creates numerous attachments to lots of objects, being physical or mental objects. This kind of attachment is fugitive. Feb 15, 2011
    Thinking in problems versus solutions is an incomplete way to think: it presumes that we can act upon all realities. Which is not true. Feb 15, 2011
    We are looking for answers without even knowing what are our questions! Feb 15, 2011
    My Friend, my heart burns when I speak Your name! Touch me with Your light for me to vanish! Feb 10, 2011
    The Beloved laughs at us when we consider ourselves so importants! Feb 10, 2011
    At some point in our faith, we meet people that will be of great help in our relation to You, my Friend! Feb 06, 2011
    Beloved, You are always here! You never turn your back on us even when some of us are caught by their ego! Lord, forgive! Feb 03, 2011
    Lord, You are guaranteeing the application of the law of causes and consequences! This law is so implacable! Jan 31, 2011
    Listen to the inward feeling: you will hear the true voice of the inside. Beyond it is the voice of the Friend! Jan 25, 2011
    A decision of the heart is a good decision. A decision of the brain is always questionnable. Jan 25, 2011
    My Friend, the Truth is worth a battle! But Truth in the world of men brings opprobrium! Let the shame flow upon myself! Jan 25, 2011
    Beloved, I am in Your hands! Why did You make me what I am, so imperfect, so small, so full of ego? Jan 25, 2011
    Beloved, you made me with an enormous ego to fight with! When it is finally under control, Your breath is my reward! Jan 19, 2011
    Beloved! I owe You everything! I even owe You the capability of saying it! Forgive us, my Friend! Jan 18, 2011
    Lord, I repent as long as I still means something! Jan 17, 2011
    Burdens are here for us to get rid of them. Each burden is a path to self-knowledge and a path to the Beloved! Jan 17, 2011
    Be in the present so much that you can touch the feet of the Beloved! Jan 17, 2011

    There are many things we cannot control. The objective is to let go our will for control and not fall into the trap of incoherence. Jan 16, 2011
    To find the represented truth, follow the track of meaning. To find truth, open and listen to your heart! Jan 15, 2011
    We need mediums because we don't want to see reality by ourselves. We want it represented because it is too frightening. Jan 15, 2011
    In Paris today, we talked about the Prophet (peace be upon him) with a taxi driver. Beloved, have mercy for us! Jan 11, 2011
    Beloved, fill the hearts with the Joy of Your presence! Put the hearts on fire for Your love! Jan 11, 2011
    Beloved Friend! You are really ruling it all! What fools can be our egos to have the pretention to believe they are in control of something! Jan 11, 2011
    Beloved, Your rules apply everywhere! I laugh while seeing each second the extend of Your glory to all fields! Jan 11, 2011
    Truth is not interesting for most of us whereas being accepted by the others is. Jan 09, 2011
    Beloved, you created the prophets as models, the saints as images of innocence and the warriors as soldiers in the spiritual fight. Jan 08, 2011
    Your breath, Beloved is the air of Live and Truth! Suddenly the instant is thick! Jan 06, 2011
    There is always a relief in truth, even if it is not the one we expected. Accepting it is always freeing oneself from illusion. Jan 03, 2011
    Our stay on Earth is so ephemere that we should behave differently. But we are afraid of future and death. So we escape from the inward. Jan 03, 2011
    Intelligence is like a river: it flows freely. When we struggle to be smart by learning lots amounts of things, we are not. Dec 31, 2010
    Some people say no one is irreplaceacle. That is true with the eye of the mind but so false with the eye of the heart! Dec 29, 2010
    Each of us has a particular path towards the dearest Friend! We are leaves searching our roots through the Tree of the Beloved! Dec 29, 2010
    People speak about a person that knew a person that knew a saint that was in contact with Him! What a pity when He's so close to our heart! Dec 29, 2010
    Good deeds are purifying the heart provided the ego finds no glory in them! Dec 29, 2010
    Don't comment! Don't intellectualize! Don't expect! Don't talk! Don't act as if! Don't imitate! Don't repeat! Forget the words for Him! Dec 28, 2010
    The path to the Beloved begins with the path to our self. It is the path of Love and acceptation of what is. Dec 28, 2010
    My Friend, You are always there, in the heart reminding! You are beyond all facts and all words, You are Love and Knowledge and Truth! Dec 27, 2010
    Most often, we are inwardly in pain,we are running away from the pain of the past and the fear of the future. Let's live the present! Dec 26, 2010
    My secret is unknown! I am unknown! Beloved, my silence is my guarantee of preserving my secret! Dec 25, 2010
    It is hard so say the truth because there are consequences. Most choose not to. If you do, make sure you do it for the love of the Friend! Dec 25, 2010
    When You touched me, suddenly lots of things had no taste anymore! Adoring You revealed my loneliness amongst men! Dec 25, 2010
    If manhood understood how silly are most of their activities, they would fall to the knees of my Friend! Dec 19, 2010
    Beloved, You turned me into a drop of love into Your Ocean! Dec 19, 2010
    When I say "I am", it is some kind of a joke for only the Beloved is! Dec 19, 2010
    Never be the slave of man! Be the slave of the Beloved! Dec 19, 2010
    If we could realize that tomorrow, all of us will be gone, we could foresee the path to the Beloved! Dec 19, 2010
    Always care about everyone, for some invisible people are saints! Dec 19, 2010

    My eyes are staring at what is! My hands are touching what is! My ears are listening to You! My heart is burning while You breathe upon me! Dec 19, 2010
    Beloved, You are here, the King of the silence, the Beginning and the End! What a strange prison You built with intellect! Dec 19, 2010
    Fear is like guilt: it is never appropriate and highly destructive. Dec 19, 2010
    Remain silent if you have second hand thoughts! Just forget those useless thoughts and listen to the voice of your heart! Dec 19, 2010
    It is not simple to discover what is sacred and what is not because a lot of things look like sacred and they are not. Dec 18, 2010
    I wish I could say intelligent things but I am a fool! I wish I could be a hero but I am a slave! Wishes are useless when we love! Dec 17, 2010
    I wish words could be heard with the heart! But as they often cannot, silence is often the best action. Dec 17, 2010
    Coincidences are the noise of facts. Love is the noise of silence. Silence is the noise of the Breath of the Beloved! Dec 17, 2010
    Playing with words is a mind illusion. Beloved, make my words rare or sharp like the Truth! Dec 17, 2010
    Playing with words is a mind illusion. Beloved, make my words rare or sharp like the Truth! Dec 16, 2010
    The more we feel we are controlling, the deeper we are swimming into illusion! Dec 16, 2010
    Our ego tries to survive, whereas when we let the Beloved manage, we realize how small is your control upon things! Dec 15, 2010
    Progress is an illusion. Let us call this "being free from inward bonds". So that we might take the journey to You, my Friend! Dec 12, 2010
    We are so used to learn things in books that we forget our knowledge of ourselves must be deep and beyond representation and comparison. Dec 12, 2010
    When an inward bond goes away, we can feel a great deal of inward space. This space is the breath of the Beloved! Dec 12, 2010
    I should say thanks all day long Beloved when I consider all that You did for me! Let us dance in loops while saying Your names in love! Dec 11, 2010
    Beloved, the web of actions and reactions is here before me. You teach me the hard way how not to reproduce events and get out of Maya. Dec 11, 2010
    My Friend, I suffered a lot, You know that. You denied me something important to give me the most important thing! Dec 11, 2010
    My Friend, You are beyond comparison and measurement. Where they are not, You are! Dec 08, 2010
    People rarely become good. When they do, You drive them to Your light, Beloved! Dec 08, 2010
    Hate is not the opposite of love. There is no measure in nor opposites to love but just lack of it! Dec 08, 2010
    Love is The rule of the universe, my dearest Friend, and to manifest It, the non-love must be manifested also! Dec 08, 2010
    Scholars are like men who try to know a city while watching its name on a map. Dec 07, 2010
    Lord, thank You for my heart burning for You! Thank You for not making me a scholar! Dec 07, 2010
    You can persue money and be money. You can persue fame and be fame. You can persue power and be power. Blessed are the Love persuers! Nov 29, 2010
    Beloved, when You make our heart burn from the inside, suddenly words don't mean anything! Nov 29, 2010
    @zumouruda :-) Nov 29, 2010
    The work of the mind is always small and partial. Let the heart do his job to encompass and reconcile all the parts that seem so different! Nov 28, 2010
    Over-analyzing is not good for it makes complex simple facts! Analyzing divides while we always need a global sight. Nov 28, 2010
    When the ego vanishes, novelty happens! Nov 28, 2010
    Don't be a Sufi for the eyes of the people! Be a lover for the eyes of the Beloved! Nov 28, 2010
    Most of people with the fire of the Beloved in their heart are not teachers! They just are invisible stars dedicated to Love! Nov 28, 2010
    Never take things too seriously except the Love of the Beloved! Nov 28, 2010
    One of the doom of mankind is that we don't understand each other because we don't listen to each other because we are in fear inwardly. Nov 28, 2010
    Sufism words may not be studied the way standards authors are, because when you look intellectually at things, things are only intellectual. Nov 28, 2010
    Your love is burning my heart! Your breath is burning my sight! Your face is burning my eyes! Your mercy is burning my ashes, Beloved! Nov 25, 2010
    Don't worship words. Just use them for the glory of the Beloved! Or remain silent! Nov 25, 2010
    Words worshipers usually never met real faith, whether they be attached to atheism or organised religious movements. Nov 25, 2010
    The fuel of the soul is faith! Nov 25, 2010
    Some say the spiritual path is long, some say the path is immediate! Let us say paths are the multiple expressions of Your will, my Friend! Nov 24, 2010
    If your mind faces no conflict, your energy to meet the Beloved is huge! Nov 24, 2010
    Be careful about the power of words for they mesmerize and enslave the mind with past ideas and prevent us to seaze the truth of present. Nov 19, 2010
    Equilibrium is a balance between a thing and its oposite. Action & reaction. We have to be out of the balance to be in peace. Nov 19, 2010
    Lord, I will never make easy money and You know why better than me! Nov 19, 2010
    Ambition is a poison killing the mind and blinding the heart! Nov 19, 2010
    Everything is relative, my Friend, including all thoughts. Except You! Nov 19, 2010
    When fighting the inward holy war, keep love and mercy in your heart! Love for what is even if it isn't what you would like it to be! Nov 14, 2010
    Beware of the traps of matters for they are lies to the brain. Just focus on what is here and now and be attentive to get out of them! Nov 14, 2010
    Always remember Me, You said! But how can "I" remember You when "I" is no more here? Nov 14, 2010
    Can I conciliate living in the world and being near to You, Beloved? Don't you, said You? Is there really a difference, said You? Nov 14, 2010
    Are You my Friend in the temple, in the mosque, in the synagogue, in the church? Don't ask silly questions, said You from within my heart! Nov 14, 2010
    If you get deeper into your self, you will find principles, conditioning, abstract rules, etc. but no personal belongings except love. Nov 14, 2010
    Every achievement made in society is always generating conflict. Nov 14, 2010
    Burn my mind! Put my heart on fire! Put tears in my eyes! Make me bleed at Your feet! Beloved, let Your Love make me vanish in extasy! Nov 14, 2010
    Self-knowledge is a door opened to You, my Friend! Nov 14, 2010
    When you search for peace or freedom or truth or the Beloved, be aware to be a searcher without really searching! Nov 14, 2010
    There is no method to search for inward peace. Let us say it is a side effect of self-knowledge. Nov 14, 2010
    Becoming can only get you a brief moment of intellectual pleasure. This is very different from the peace you can get while just being. Nov 14, 2010
    Social ways of learning mean nothing in spiritual matters. The less you keep in your mind, the better you will travel to the Beloved! Nov 13, 2010
    Let me tell you one secret: you never become someone else just because you try hard to do so. This is a mind illusion. Nov 13, 2010
    A reason why we are constantly at war with ourselves is that we want to become. If you just are, inward conflicts vanish. Nov 13, 2010
    It is easy to want peace in the outside world, but inside war is the cause of outside war. Understanding inside war leads to peace. Nov 13, 2010
    When the heart is speaking, the words are just the skeleton of what is said! Nov 13, 2010
    What is meditation? A lot of people think they know but do they? Nov 13, 2010
    @zumouruda Oui n'est-ce pas ? C'est une petite femelle de 2 ans qui fait environ 5 kg! Elle est très vive! Nov 11, 2010
    If you really act, are you sure we are talking about "you"? Nov 08, 2010
    If you act by reaction, you don't act in the absolute but you act in a relationship to something. The real act just happens without a cause! Nov 08, 2010
    To be a rebel, you have to fight against something. And what about fighting for something you just feel, without being in a reaction? Nov 08, 2010
    Revolution is not for the outward world but for the inward one. Instead of wanting to change the world, how about changing yourself first? Nov 08, 2010
    The master is pure love and cannot hurt you. You can, in full confidence, lean on him. That kind of confidence is based in Love! Nov 08, 2010
    The world made up by man's hand can be boring... But not Yours, Beloved! Men build their mental prisons while they need You to be free! Nov 08, 2010
    Analysis is just a mind division with an observer and an observed in a single mind. So another word for analysis is neurosis, isn't it? Nov 07, 2010
    Lord, I love when You speak to me through people! Nov 07, 2010
    Minds are so conditionned! Only You can open the eyes of the heart for all ideas to be turned to ashes and scattered by the wind of Love! Nov 07, 2010
    @zumouruda Oui je suis d'accord ! Que le Bien-Aimé te garde et enflamme to coeur ! Nov 07, 2010

    Please don't RT me! For the Beloved's sake, if my words mean something to you, make them yours and forget about quoting! Nov 06, 2010
    Why searching to be distracted all the time? Because we are void and run out of fear from ourselves! Nov 06, 2010
    Beloved, make me forget for I can die every day to the cumulative obsession of the mind! Nov 06, 2010
    People compete in brightness! Could they compete with their hearts that would reflect You, my Friend, in multiple ways! Nov 06, 2010
    Mind the way your mind work so that you can lose the illusion of mastering! Nov 06, 2010
    Run from concepts! Run from second-hand thoughts! Run from the fruit of experience that enslaves us! Run in His arms! Nov 06, 2010
    Even holy words can be a veil between you and Him, if they are only intellectual words and not truths in your heart! Nov 06, 2010
    I don't have any opinions! I don't have a past! I don't have ideals! I don't have any experience! I am so empty that I disappeared for Love! Nov 04, 2010
    You don't have to get diplomas to drink in the tavern! You don't have to train your brain to come closer to Him! Just let the mind rest! Nov 04, 2010
    Esoterists read the meanings behind the written words. That is useless for we only have to read our feelings behind our minds! Nov 04, 2010
    My Friend, I pause my mind and feel the Love in my loneliness suddenly filled with Your breath! Nov 04, 2010
    Don't try to be someone else! Don't escape from yourself! Don't plan to become what you should be! Just be here and now with the Beloved! Nov 04, 2010
    @zumouruda oui, je suis navré. Sans doute devrais-je écrire dans les deux langues ! Nov 04, 2010
    There is no progress in spiritual matters, just what you are now! Nov 04, 2010
    @zumouruda Salam, je vais bien ! Et toi, comment vas-tu ? Nov 04, 2010
    My Friend, You are here and now in the very moment we live. To be in Your eternity, we have to live at now and not to enter a roadmap! Nov 04, 2010
    Each and every moment, the path is renewed by Your dance, Beloved! Nov 02, 2010
    Going to You my Friend is not a unique path. Everyone of us will follow a distinct path where all recipes will not work! Oct 31, 2010
    Don't be a pool of water aside from the river. Join the moving flow and go to Him! Oct 31, 2010

    To be creative, we have to have inward space for feelings and ideas to be born. Otherwise we just repeat or copy. Oct 30, 2010
    Technical knowledge is useful for living in this world but it must never drive the inward being. The inward must be free to be creative. Oct 30, 2010
    I used to write Meaningless words! I used to pursue Meaningless purposes! Now I'm confident For Your breath Is making me breathe! Oct 26, 2010
    Beloved, I laugh when I realize that "I" cannot be, that "I" cannot act, that You pull the strings while "I" is dissolved in Your Ocean! Oct 26, 2010
    Becoming is not being, becoming is un-being. Having a goal is not acting. Beloved, let me be and act in the past-less present! Oct 26, 2010
    If we are attached to something, we are slaves. If we want to be something, we are not. Lord, here and now is the eternity of Your dance! Oct 26, 2010
    So many things occur... and have no meaning! So many people walk... and are dead! My Friend, en-light the heart of the living with Love! Oct 26, 2010

    Damned ego! Always where you never expect it! Oct 23, 2010

    Some of us seek for a gem while it is in their heart. Don't be like a sterile mine: don't bury your heart deep down underground. Oct 19, 2010
    My patience is huge, my Friend, but this patience goes with realizing that silence is best for heartless people. Oct 19, 2010

    Did you ever observe your thoughts? How they were born, develop and end? If you do, you can discover inward silence and what is attention. Oct 05, 2010
    Sometimes our imperfection is revealed suddenly! And we are smaller than ants! Beloved, forgive me for being such a fool! Oct 05, 2010
    @zumouruda Our hearts burn in the flames of His love! May the Beloved protect You and fill your heart with Joy! Oct 05, 2010
    When I express something about You, I am so wrong! But when I keep quiet, I want to express something about You! Love breaks the silence! Oct 04, 2010
    In the galaxy of worlds, You stand, my Friend, here at now, in this eternal now, dancing on and on! Oct 04, 2010
    Don't travel to see the world, if you are blind! Don't listen to all music, if you are deaf! Don't praise Him if your heart isn't burning! Oct 04, 2010
    Life is a mystery our intellect would like to abstract. But Your laughter, Beloved, is the wind that blows all attempts of the mind! Oct 03, 2010
    Untangling the strings of the past is one of the condition to meet You now, my Friend, in that dancing present that is! Oct 03, 2010
    We have to feel things deep inside for things to have value. Thoughts are only the shadows of life. Oct 02, 2010
    We are the tools of creation, preservation and destruction forces provided we are attached to this world. Attachment to You is freeing us! Sep 29, 2010
    My Friend, it is so obvious we have to trust You and only You because we control nothing! Creator, Maintainer, Destroyer, You are in charge! Sep 28, 2010
    There is always a root for anxiety that is not the visible reason for it. Sep 26, 2010
    When we want to be something we are not, we are being silly. Because all You expect us to be, Beloved, is what we are! Sep 24, 2010
    Don't ask what is the evil of men: ego. Sep 20, 2010
    Your Bliss is dancing everywhere, is penetrating everything, to begin with what is left of me, Beloved Friend! Sep 17, 2010
    Confidence goes with love. Your Confidence, my Friend, goes much further than confidence! It goes with Bliss and Mercy! Sep 17, 2010
    Find God in men and women before meeting Him! Sep 17, 2010
    Religious people are like magnets that attract other people with religious sensitivity and sensitive people looking for confidence. Sep 17, 2010

    There are so many suffering in this world! Besides basic needs, so many people are confused and suffer! Beloved, help them go to You! Sep 16, 2010
    Some secrets are not secret because we have to hide them but because, even told, they are not understood. Sep 15, 2010

    Imagine the freedom of not having to be right or wrong! Imagine the freedom not to have intellectual opinions! Taking things as they are! Aug 04, 2010
    Hear when we talk about philosophy. We want to be right. We want to have the final answer. But how many of us remain silent? Aug 04, 2010
    We are craving so much for solutions, final solutions that would make us forget the problem, that we don't even look if the problem exists. Aug 04, 2010
    Don't forget you are what you seek! That's why you have to seek for love! Aug 02, 2010

    Imagine a soul that cannot hurt you! Imagine a being with no inward danger! He is my master! And he serves You, Beloved! Aug 02, 2010

    We can always borrow the thoughts from others, but that does not make us brighter. Jul 30, 2010

    Wanting to suffer is an urbane behaviour coming from those who did not suffer. Those who did suffer seek for peace. Jul 24, 2010
    Sometimes I blame myself for being slow to forgive! Then You come to make me understand I was just impatient! Jul 24, 2010
    @zumouruda Thank you for that my dear! Right people are led by the Beloved! Let Him be with you always and protect you! Jul 23, 2010
    So much things to say, Beloved, and words won't come out of my mouth! This is not the time, not the place, not the right people! Jul 21, 2010
    Lord, I stay voiceless before Your Highness! When I stare at You, nothing exists my Friend! Jul 21, 2010

    I was once reading books. Then You ruined my poor self by coming in, Beloved! I was dead to books and reborn in Your ink! Jul 15, 2010
    In the wine of Your tavern, I hear my heart sing Your names up to the point when I cannot say who's hearing! Jul 15, 2010
    You gave so many to me, my Lord! You gave me love and heart and breath and satisfaction! Giving is one attribute of Yours! Jul 15, 2010

    From time to time, I realize my Lord that most of people don't understand when I am speaking. Help me bring Your Words through the heart! Jul 12, 2010
    The ego always looses. Jul 12, 2010
    Feeling pride inside us as an act of ego is transforming: we face the demon inside. Then we realize how hard the control can be. Jul 12, 2010

    Entering the path of Sufism is entering the path of Truth for it it only under the light of Truth that we can be one with You, Beloved! Jul 07, 2010

    Expression can always be an approximation when truth and love are concerned. To face that fact, we can remain silent or iterate! Jul 04, 2010
    There are no such things as means to an end. There are only the means. Jul 04, 2010

    Following Your signs does not mean trying to find the signs You left, Beloved! It means being aware of things that happen the way they do! Jul 03, 2010
    The path of devotion or the path of the heart is so full of marvels that even a single name of Yours gives us shivers down our spine! Jul 03, 2010
    Intellect leads to You, my Friend, but this path is dangerous and rarely successful. It requires the clear and pure mind of the seeker! Jul 03, 2010
    We often get stuck into the veils of poor or materialistic wisdom. Unveiling wisdom one veil at a time is one of the path to the Beloved. Jul 03, 2010
    I am so silly! I am such a fool! I am enslaved in Your love with no choice! But who can have a choice? Who is this I between You and You? Jul 02, 2010

    One may ask if it is legitimate I should talk about You! What is Your purpose, Lord? You questionning Yourself? Jul 02, 2010
    Most of us don't realize You rule, my Friend! Blinded by our ego, persuing the mirages of what should be, we are toys in Your hands! Jul 02, 2010
    Beloved, give me the strength to go on and on with the people around and show them Your reign in my very actions! Jul 02, 2010
    If we enter the path of truth, we can discover how far it is while being so close to us! Jun 30, 2010
    Sometimes Beloved, You speak through my mouth! And I observe! And I listen! I does not mean a lot in the shadow of Your feet! Jun 29, 2010

    RT @MaaritJohanna: "Without love there is nothing but grief.In love… what else matters?" -Rumi- Jun 29, 2010
    The path to You my Friend brings hapiness but not in the way those who are seeking happiness can imagine, more like a kind of "side effect"! Jun 29, 2010
    We are today as manhood centuries ago. Except that we are sure to be more evolved that our ancestors! This is unfortunately untrue! Jun 29, 2010
    When we are thinking things, we should realize thousands of people are thinking the same at the same moment! This is good for the ego! Jun 29, 2010
    Most of us don't believe anymore in love, in peace, in freedom or in truth as if those notions were out of date. That is the easy way! Jun 29, 2010
    Mastering the ego is a phase of Jihad. Jun 29, 2010
    Mastering the ego brings an intense feeling of harmony and piece - provided we feel that it is not "me" that masters the ego! Jun 29, 2010
    There are so many things we should not take personally because they are not. But it hurts our ego! Jun 29, 2010
    Even very old, most of us seek desperately the love of our mother and the appreciation of our father! So many lives are driven by that! Jun 28, 2010
    Religion is the path to You, my Friend, You I hear most when the noises of the day have fainted. This path is made of light and truth! Jun 28, 2010
    Some of us have religious names and they despise religion or are ashamed of their name! Beloved, how ironic You can be! Jun 28, 2010
    To walk on the path of light, we have to love You, Beloved, and repent for moments we did love our ego! Jun 28, 2010

    Beloved, a request: make me act more and talk less! Jun 26, 2010
    Some of us are not trustworthy. That means that they see the ones who are as people that are not! Jun 26, 2010

    I don't believe in monotony because I had the chance never to experience it! Jun 25, 2010
    Even in the last exhausted hour, Beloved, You are here! Charmed, I watch the eternally changing worlds bowing to You, my Friend! Jun 25, 2010
    To be able to want, you have to be someone. When you are noone, what desire could you have except contemplating the feet of the Beloved? Jun 24, 2010

    One day, we have to choose: ego or religion. Jun 24, 2010
    Lots of us have religious feelings but they do recognize them as such because the society they live in despise organized religions. Jun 24, 2010
    Lots of us confuse wisdom with personal desires or motivational quotes or void sentences. Jun 24, 2010
    I always knew no "me" was real inwardly. #jeudiconfession Jun 24, 2010

    Am I a Muslim, Lord? Am I a Hindu? A Christian or a Jew? A Buddhist or a Taoist? An Atheist? Beloved, I am all that You need me to be! Jun 23, 2010
    If we listen inwardly carefully, we will hear a gret deal of fear to heal. Love is the remedy to fear. Jun 23, 2010
    When we feel we have to go to You, Beloved, we know that the path will be long and hard and perilous! But we go step by step, loving! Jun 23, 2010
    The spiritual path begins by seeing the inward and outward worlds as they are and accept these as facts. Jun 23, 2010
    Wisdom is never mundane. Jun 23, 2010
    There comes a time when the weight of the past must be dealt with. If we don't, we lock ourselves into caricatural behaviors. Jun 23, 2010
    Beloved, how impressive is a common day on Your side! The more I abandon the fruits of my acts to You, the more You are here! Jun 22, 2010
    When we want to criticize someone or something, we should be clean on our side or critics become silliness. Jun 22, 2010
    Chère @zumouruda Merci beaucoup mais je n'y suis pour rien ! Cela vient du Bien-Aimé ! Jun 22, 2010
    Spiritual people should take care of not being mundane, especially not spiritually mundane. Jun 22, 2010
    I came to You, Beloved, to question about my vision. You said to me only one word: "practice!" Jun 21, 2010
    This night, Beloved, cold came after the storm. Under the frozen stars, I speak your names! Let the worlds dance in Your sama! Jun 20, 2010
    Beloved, my master is a mirror of Your light, a door to Your kingdom, a path for the rusty hearts, a hand to learn to walk! Jun 20, 2010
    Take care not to confuse obedience and discipline. Jun 20, 2010
    We are always too pretentious, too proud, too self-centered. This is the curse of men. Only religion can cure that disease of the heart. Jun 20, 2010
    Truth can provoke understanding as it can provoke fear, reject, hatred or will for revenge. Master, show us how and when to speak the truth! Jun 20, 2010
    The truth can be as hard as a weapon. That is why it must be used carefully, and often unsaid. Jun 20, 2010
    Be kind and forgiving to yourself and you will be able to be kind and forgiving to others! Jun 20, 2010
    Mistakes are not failures. Indeed, for all of us there are no failures, but just mistakes. Jun 20, 2010
    We cannot erase the mistakes of the past. However we must accept them and dig into them to understand their causes and not make them again. Jun 20, 2010
    Hoarding words is of no use for me because those words are not mine but Yours! We cannot keep photos of each second of the life of a river! Jun 19, 2010
    Men can evolve in two directions: the diminution of ego or its reinforcement. Jun 19, 2010
    Men are like filters: some are keeping the wheat from the chaff; others are doing the reverse. Jun 17, 2010
    The rain does not complain of being low! The dirt does not complain of transporting the ashes of the dead! I do not complain, Dearest! Jun 17, 2010
    Lord, You are like the tide to men: You always come back! I wish I could follow this model! Jun 17, 2010

    The rain is pouring down from hours! It is like we were in a safe dry acquarium in the middle of the sea! Jun 15, 2010
    One day the earth is dry and its skin is broken. Then comes the rain and the mud and the green reappears! This is what You do to men! Jun 15, 2010
    My Friend, forgive me to be human! You know I always come back to You! Accept Lord the burning of my heart for You! Jun 14, 2010
    Beloved, You solved so many problems in me! You burnt so many bonds! You burnt a part of the I! Now, I is like a wave on the lake of love! Jun 14, 2010
    Lord, You blessed me with simplicity of the mind! That is why I am such a fool! A fool that sings Your tawhid by dancing in circles! Jun 14, 2010
    It is not possible to small talk when You are there, Dancer of the worlds! Your dance turns all words into ashes! Jun 14, 2010
    I wish I could talk about me, but there is nothing to say! I wish I could talk about a passion but You exceed all passion! Jun 14, 2010
    Some truths just can be spoken out loud, can they, my Lord? Their realization is part of the heart's polishing! Jun 13, 2010
    I bend before Thee, my Friend! I sing Thy glory, King of kings! I laugh at Thy jokes, Eternal One! And that's why I am seen as a fool! Jun 13, 2010
    Too many of us are locked inside a duality: 'I like' versus 'I dislike'. Criticism runs both ways from the two faces of the same coin. Jun 13, 2010
    When we look carefully at our lives, we discover that, in spite of what we may believe, we do not master a lot of things. Jun 13, 2010
    Understanding is like unveiling: we think we understood but later on, we discover some new deepness in that truth. And so on with each veil. Jun 13, 2010
    In order to understand action, you have to understand the absence of action. Jun 12, 2010
    The secret of my heart is a light that is not metaphorical! Yours, Lord of the looping universes! Jun 12, 2010
    When you have no secrets, it is easy to say you have ones and that they are well kept! Jun 12, 2010
    Lord, You are the only one that knows all our little secrets! I wish I had none! But You know :-) Jun 12, 2010
    Bruckner 9th symphony: definitely inspired by You, my Friend! Jun 12, 2010

    Some of us may appear to use second level humor. But indeed some of us mean it. Jun 11, 2010
    Beware of self-destructive people. Most of them want company in their self-destruction. Only love can save them, and sometimes only You. Jun 11, 2010
    Some influences are bad to us. But most of us need time to fully realize it. Above all because bad always mimics good. Jun 11, 2010
    Our heart may be dirty, it is not by pretending it isn't that we will take out the rust it is covered with. Jun 11, 2010
    Guide humanity, dear Friend, because we are so lost without Your guidance! Jun 11, 2010
    Frogs are singing Your glory in my garden, Beloved! Jun 11, 2010
    The night is cloudy and soundy as if the sounds were locked under the clouds. Jun 11, 2010
    So often, I would like to reply or comment but I can't. Beloved, You know that words can heal only the open hearts! Jun 10, 2010
    Most of us are just posers. Jun 10, 2010
    Try one day not to lie nor accomodate reality just a bit in your words. Jun 10, 2010
    If you seek what is under your mask, you might be disappointed! Jun 10, 2010
    Lots of people want to be actors. That is funny because most of us are good ones. Jun 10, 2010
    Between us and the Truth, You put thousands of veils, my Lord! Unveiling reality makes us look each 'known' thing with a new eye! Jun 10, 2010
    Amongst the loops of the worlds, I sit, looking at Your lotus feet, Beloved! Jun 10, 2010
    Fortunately, I am the fool in that place as in other places! Smiling at You like a madman, my Friend! Jun 10, 2010
    Our ego loves to talk publicly to show his supposed intelligence or culture or talent! Jun 10, 2010
    If being an artist means making a living with the deep darkness in us, then it may often be incompatible with a spiritual path. Jun 09, 2010
    I am not the authors if my words! You, Beloved, are talking through my mouth, bringing ideas and feeling as You wish! Jun 09, 2010
    @zumouruda Oui, le Bien-Aimé habite ces instants merveilleux... Comme les autres d'ailleurs :-) Jun 09, 2010
    My master is pure love and carries no trace of danger. All things he says are just pointing to the Beloved. Jun 09, 2010
    http://tweetphoto.com/26257058 This night in my garden. Jun 08, 2010
    Beloved, so many voices speak by your lipless mouth! So many words and such a silence! May Your light always guide me to Your proximity! Jun 08, 2010
    The way we quote reveals a lot about us. Jun 08, 2010
    My thoughts aren't really mine ; most of them are indeed common to a lot of persons that are sure theirs are unique! Jun 08, 2010
    You know well, my Friend, how much I am small, miserable and imperfect! I can bear myself just when this self ceases to be mine! Jun 07, 2010
    Lord of the tavern, pour wine in my cup for me to drown into the infinite where I does not exist! Jun 07, 2010
    Soma false gurus are fond of rhetorics, because they can always be right. Jun 07, 2010
    A kind of false gurus are fond of measure and degrees. Jun 07, 2010
    To go to You, my Friend, one needs to get rid of measure and comparison! Jun 07, 2010
    Compete, friends of worship, in speaking the names of the Beloved! Compete, dervishes of the tavern, in chanting the Tawhid of the Unique! Jun 07, 2010
    @zumouruda oh yes indeed, and love is the fuel for this journey to the Beloved! Jun 07, 2010
    Beloved, years ago, You said to me that I should polish my heart! I started this huge work not realizing what harsh path it could be! Jun 06, 2010
    There are things You kept in my heart and that I cannot tell, my Lord, things that are meant to be secretly passed from heart to heart! Jun 06, 2010
    Rhetorics come with judgement. Jun 06, 2010
    @zumouruda Oui, la rose rouge nous attire avec sa beauté et son parfum, nous entraînant dans la Passion folle du Bien-Aimé ! Jun 06, 2010
    Most of us only understand things based on their own experience. Empathy makes the understanding larger. Blessed are those with inward eye! Jun 06, 2010
    Most philosophers just don't see the world or listen to others. They prefer inventing their world while listening to themselves only. Jun 05, 2010
    It is easier to get influenced by darkness than by light. Beloved, keep on enlightening me till the end! Jun 05, 2010

    My special #FF available for all days of the week: the Beloved! Jun 05, 2010
    I realize I may have made a mistake in figures. An inversion maybe ;-) Jun 05, 2010
    I am 93 tomorrow. Thanks to You my Friend for making me live so long after I was reborn by Your hand! Jun 04, 2010
    Beloved, You are hiding in plain sight! You are hidden in silences! You are within the simplest reality! You are so obvious for the heart! Jun 03, 2010
    Emptiness is inside all of us, except that this emptiness is filled with Your light for he who has eyes to see! Jun 03, 2010
    In the garden of the Gardener, there are just born roses, roses that cannot be more beautiful and roses that passed away to feed the dirt. Jun 03, 2010
    Beloved, You know that we are not perfect and despite all that, You keep on loving us! Jun 03, 2010
    All the things I saw in other people are my own flaws. But only you Beloved can really know how far I may be from my master! Jun 02, 2010
    My Lord, clean up my mind as the storms cleans up the sea, for the sun of Your love to shine on the wavelets of my heart! Jun 02, 2010
    The mind is like a forge: you have to feed it so the fire will burn. The hotter the greater the unconfort. Or you can make it starve. Jun 02, 2010
    So many of us feel insecure inwardly as if the decisions we made were irreversible. Fortunately, You forgive, Beloved! Jun 02, 2010
    Some people inconsciouly create physical obstacles around them. This often illustrates the psychological obstacles of their minds. Jun 02, 2010
    Lord, so many moments of joy in Your company! Joy of being your toy, whirling amongst the winds! O Unique, what am I to dare to name You! Jun 01, 2010
    I was a person, You annihilated me! I was a brain, You turned it into ashes! I was blind, You made me see! I was fool and You made it worse! Jun 01, 2010
    We will meet again my Friend! We will meet thousands of times! In all places, at all moments! Wherever I go, because You are everywhere! Jun 01, 2010
    Time will pass as the wind goes. Yesterday we were ashes and ashes we will be tomorrow. Meanwhile, I stay close to You, Dearest Friend. Jun 01, 2010
    Round and round and on and on, this whirling dance is like You, Beloved, when You are dancing with the worlds! May 31, 2010
    I was filled with myself, You voided me! I could not looked at the sun, You dazzled the sun! I was in love, You burnt me to ashes! May 31, 2010
    Drink again dervish! Drink the wine from the mud pot, that very pot made of the clay of Kings and other dervishes! May 31, 2010
    My Dearest Friend! You are the Light of lights, the Heart of hearts, the Love of loves! Come and stay longer for me to forget myself! May 31, 2010
    If you need a pure guide on earth, follow the truth. If your heart is burning from it, sink into love! May 31, 2010
    Wisdom requires heart and intelligence. Or just truth. May 31, 2010
    Intelligence is no wisdom. May 31, 2010
    Despite the storm, my Friend, despite the winds screaming in the forests, despite everything that happens, You remain the Same! May 31, 2010
    Lord, Your names create joy, peace, growth! Gardener, let me be a rose in Your garden before I burn! May 30, 2010
    The wind is blowing over the mountains tonight. In prayer, I go close to You, Dearest! May this wind bring love in the windy hearts! May 30, 2010
    In the flow of the world, we need to have the capability to discern. Then we must be able to speak the truth. May 30, 2010
    Canaille http://tweetphoto.com/24725474 May 30, 2010
    Beloved, guide my poor self on the path of the seven valleys! Like the weakest child of Yours, let me follow Your guidance of love! May 29, 2010
    Truth is simple as love is. But some of us just don't get simple things, especially when the heart is speaking :-) May 29, 2010
    A lot of us strike to be original. What a funny idea above all when you know we are all alike! May 29, 2010
    The wise man is somehow aside from the world. May 29, 2010
    On the spiritual path, we have to forget about books and words to let space for action in the present reality. May 29, 2010
    Thought fragmentation is a danger. May 29, 2010
    The issue of quoting is that we can quote quotes and so on, until our thought is reduced to a patchwork of other's thoughts. May 29, 2010
    Rather than thinking by ourselves, we feel confortable to quote recognized people that think as we do, as if we were lacking confidence. May 29, 2010
    Step aside, said the Beloved, and watch the world breathing as it is. May 29, 2010
    Intellect and beauty are the pride of ego. May 29, 2010
    Philosophers see the world with their brains. Sufis see it with the heart and brains. May 29, 2010
    In my weakest state, You are so near my Friend that nothing else exists! May 28, 2010
    I wish I could thank my Creator as He deserves but that is far too prententious :-) May 28, 2010
    Listening to others is listening to You, my Friend. May 27, 2010
    My Lord, You are the guidance of men in the maze of their life! May 27, 2010
    All light is coming from you Beloved! All other light is just a metaphor of Your glory! May 27, 2010
    If your ego is too big, bend it before the Beloved. May 27, 2010
    What is life? Love, love and then love. You can loose everything provide you do not lose love. May 27, 2010
    To be nearer from the Princess, just listen to Her silences carefully and with Love! May 26, 2010
    Beloved, You play on me as with an out of tune instrument: sometimes I sing, sometimes I groan. What a strange melody is my life's sound! May 26, 2010
    Wisedom is inward poverty. May 26, 2010
    People think too often they are stupid and so they learn more. But what they should learn is that they already know to much to be smart. May 26, 2010
    The roses of the garden are well kept and bred by the Gardiner. Their perfume is an invisible secret and their thorns are symbolic. May 26, 2010
    O glorious Master of Realms and Kingdoms! You are the Utmost, the Unique with thousands of names! Dance the worlds in motion for us to love! May 26, 2010
    Mon maître est à mes côtés, souriant et chaleureux. Il est à côté de tout sauf du Bien-Aimé. Sa baraka m'a touché, moi le vermisseau. May 26, 2010
    Ego is the gazoline for Karma's law. With ni ego, attachment disappears and we become like the water of the river going to the Ocean. May 25, 2010
    Focus your mind on the Beloved and realize the I is not there anymore! May 25, 2010
    When a man is freed of women and gold, then he can enter the path of the Greatest. May 24, 2010
    Some of is realize they are toys for one another, some don't, some persue it. Indeed, we are all toys of Karma's law. Except saints perhaps. May 24, 2010
    Discover people by yourself and not from what other people may say about them. May 24, 2010
    Forgiveness is a name of Yours, Beloved, a name that is so close to our daily existence! May 24, 2010
    When you look at your own unspeakable faults and sins, you can learn what forgiveness is. May 24, 2010
    @zumouruda Je me demande :-) Mais les mots sont si loin du ressenti du coeur ! May 24, 2010
    Nostalgia is a feeling that cripples the soul. Dig inside you in order for the light to make nostagia vanish! May 24, 2010
    @zumouruda Et quelle gloire que celle du Bien-Aimé ! May 24, 2010

    My Lord, do turn the big wheel of causes and consequences, of beginnings and endings, of life and death for us to be dazzled! May 21, 2010
    Beware of rhetoric. It is seducing though a simple mind game. May 20, 2010
    I met You yesterday, Greatest, and the day before and in all the loops of sama! Be those loops endless, I would never be able to know You! May 19, 2010
    I am so tired and old in this shiny and young world! I will soon go back to my Master! May 19, 2010
    Don't ruin people's hopes. May 19, 2010
    My Friend, Your hand is the one one should grasp in the path! Let the blessed by You guide the others towards Your light! May 19, 2010
    Beloved, You opened the eye of my eyes, the heart of my heart! And I discovered You while all my sins became obvious! May 19, 2010
    In Occident, lots of people believe in progress. Not just technical progress. It is indeed a strange belief. May 19, 2010
    People from Occident often despise other people just by considering superior their science and culture. May 19, 2010
    All things are a bridge towards reality. May 18, 2010
    Ian Curtis died 30 years ago today. May his soul rest in piece with the Beloved! May 18, 2010
    In the very deep of that very second, you are there, my Friend, majesty and almighty. I sink in dreams under your wing of light! May 17, 2010
    Dance my Lord amongst the tormented minds! Bring your light to those in despair! Your breath next to my hear is chanting soundless words! May 17, 2010
    Waves will die / While flatness comes / Im the deep water / Your light shines May 17, 2010
    You will calm / My ocean of words / You will clean / The lake of my soul / May 17, 2010
    When I speak, my master sees I am naive. Except when love speaks by my mouth! May 16, 2010
    Sunset http://tweetphoto.com/22713035 May 16, 2010
    La lumière de la compréhension est ténue car l'ombre de l'erreur est diffuse. Filtre la vérité avec ton coeur pour recevoir cette lumière ! May 16, 2010
    In my weakness I get nearer to You / In my vanishing I get drunk / In my sorrow I cry for You to return / In my love I burn to ashes! May 15, 2010
    Beloved, You found me back after my ego played to myself a new trickery, mirror of past times! Stay longer, Dearest for me to forget the I! May 15, 2010
    Beloved, You are laughter on the faces of Your creatures! You laugh when men are guided or lost! Make me share the crumbs of Your laughter! May 13, 2010

    One attribute of Shaytan is ego. This implies that ego is strangely perhaps not personal. Beloved, make love crush the ego! May 12, 2010
    Ego, my Friend, is keen to build traps that can't be unlocked - but by You. May 12, 2010
    No one knows me like You do / No one loves me like You do / No one gave me as much as You did / Motion of the three worlds! May 12, 2010
    Some dead peole are alive in reality while some alive people don't know they are dead. May 11, 2010
    Beloved! Your presence is so strong that I burnt in Your whereabouts! My burnt ashes fly in Your dancing breath! Loop the worlds, Dearest! May 11, 2010
    In my master, I find purity and truth and love of a being that is totally out of the matter web. May 11, 2010
    Ego is blinding us. Doubt is good for ego when we speak of matter. In the heart, my Friend, there is no doubt! May 11, 2010
    Words and concepts must not become idols. May 11, 2010
    Most of the time, light comes out of positive discussions. May 10, 2010
    In the reminding of Your name, I came back to You while deleting my self. May 09, 2010
    Some of us will have a long path in the afterlife to get things together. May 09, 2010
    J'ai vu aujourd'hui des vieux ne croyant plus à l'amour mais au monde matériel. Avec mes mille ans, je suis nouveau né face à eux. May 09, 2010
    The rain is pouring and You are here waiting for me. In You infinite mercy towards everyone, You are sometimes so close then so absent! May 09, 2010

    Two days ago, the birds of my garden were crying out loud for spring to come at last. May 09, 2010
    In the quiet and still night, I pray for Your mercy to bring love over all of humans! Dance, Lord, dance with the worlds! May 08, 2010
    Beloved, You created infinite mazes for us to get lost - but you also opened your well guarded rose garden for darvishes to drink! May 08, 2010
    Freud voyait la sexualité partout alors qu'il aurait fallu voir les choses plus simplement : l'amour et le manque d'amour. May 08, 2010
    In humankind suffering, lack of love is one of the most painful state. May 08, 2010
    We are craving for love Dearest Friend because we cannot feel how strong Your love is for all of us! May 08, 2010
    Beloved, You placed us here in a web of causes and consequences with love as the only way to breathe. Have mercy on us! May 08, 2010
    All our words and issues will soon be ashes cleaned up by the rain. May 08, 2010
    Understanding is nothing when without love. May 08, 2010
    My Friend, how can you be so huge and powerful and mercyful? Make me drink from your breath and closed lips! May 07, 2010
    When you see a thing in someone, this thing could be in yourself. Let the Beloved polish our heart in the mirror of human beings! May 07, 2010
    I know that I am nothing. I know that I is nothing. I know that I is You! May 07, 2010
    In the path of Love, Dearest Friend, you are Love! In the path of inward burning, You are Void! Let Your love burn me inwardly to ashes! May 06, 2010
    The world is made of Your signs that are so dazzling that most of us cannot see them! Your dance is the world's pulse! May 06, 2010
    Lord, when my body dies, make sure my ashes are used to make pots for the religious beings to drink from it! May 06, 2010
    The love for You is the fuel of my heart! Without it, I would be ashes! May 06, 2010
    Beloved, make me slow down everything and stay still in Your breath where nothing else exists. May 06, 2010
    I bow to You, old Friend, Creator and HereAndNow! But as the waters lies down in the bottom of the valley, I bow to the bottom of water! May 06, 2010
    My Lord, what fun You make of things! Humans see the chaos while You are Order! Keep on dancing loops with the Universe! May 06, 2010
    Here and there, now and ever, I will praise for Your lips without words to burn me to ashes! Beloved! Pulse my blood a bit more for love! May 06, 2010
    I face my real void. And You are there. Is I there too? Not tonight. Just Your fingers typing Your names on and on. May 06, 2010
    Etrange sensation, n'est-ce pas, chère @zumouruda ? May 06, 2010
    Parfois, j'ai l'impression d'avoir mille ans tant je suis vieux et que ma barbe est blanche. Pourtant, mon Ami est plus présent que jamais. May 05, 2010
    RT @HafizQuotes: I have learned so much from God that I can no longer call myself a Christian, a Hindu, a Muslim, a Buddhist, a Jew. May 05, 2010
    Lord, You gave me the strength to face and accept and understand what is. In a path of solitude and inner void. May 05, 2010
    Mon secret est si vaste que rien ne peut le contenir. Il est si ténu qu'on pourrait le croire vide. Il est tissé dans les fibres du coeur. May 05, 2010
    Beloved, You are the source of the light reflecting on my heart that I polish hardly. So many veils are between us while You are so close! May 05, 2010
    Old rishis were right and their wisdom is a treasure. But who better than I can make the I better before the I vanishes in You? May 05, 2010
    Beloved, guide the blind in Your path! Guide the ones seeking truth in Your path! Guide the ones which mind seeks the One to You! May 05, 2010
    The day is ending Mercyful Friend, a long day of men and women agitation. Let peace touch them in their sleep. May 05, 2010
    Words are so useless. May 05, 2010
    Within the house of wine, You stand. Within the wine, You stand. Withing the veils hiding the heart, You stand. Within the heart, You stand! May 04, 2010
    My end is near, Great Friend, my end which is to you just a second of form taken by mud. May my dirt be used for other dervishes! May 04, 2010
    Let me drink, Friend of the friends! Let me drink from the glass of mud made with the dead princes, poets and poor people! Before I leave! May 04, 2010
    In the cold cloudy night, the silence is Your language, the presence is Your mystery, the flame of the heart is Your breath! May 04, 2010
    Ego, again and again, is blinding people about what they really are. When the ego stands in the way, the mirror is dark. May 04, 2010
    I sing Your names, Dearest! I call Your face, Heart of the heart! I invoke Your breath, oh Lord! I turn on and on and on in Your universe! May 03, 2010
    Oh Beloved! Oh my Friend! Are we pawns you play with? Are we music instruments you play unto? Definitely we are dancers in your sama! May 03, 2010
    Our mind is so full of patterns that we only seek for the repetition of the known and we don't see the present. May 03, 2010
    Manhood tends to tackle problems on a superficial way. The depth of truth remains out of reach for most of us. May 03, 2010
    Words are meant to be forgotten for people to continue walking on their path. May 02, 2010
    @zumouruda: Salam Zumouruda, que la lumière d'Allah soit avec toi! May 02, 2010
    We are eveyone, we are everything and yet we are nothing! Beloved enchant the world that dances around us! May 02, 2010
    @zumouruda Bonjour :-) May 02, 2010
    Manhood would be more calm if everyone had nothing to prove to the others. May 02, 2010
    Le pessimisme ou le cynisme sont acceptables socialement tandis que la vérité vous fait passer pour un fou. May 01, 2010

    My wife is a like the sky: she is the purest being when stormy clouds are not here to hide her beauty. May 01, 2010
    If we want wisdom, we can find it because it is not hidden. But is our heart ready to accept the truth of it? May 01, 2010
    Words are meant to understand that we have to burn them inside with the rest of the 'I' May 01, 2010
    Occidental culture obeys the same accumulation logic than material assets. Indeed, culture is matter and it obstructs the mind. Apr 30, 2010
    One disease of the mind is to see things through the right and wrong glasses. Apr 30, 2010
    Beloved, having changed the way I see, You changed also the way I speak and the way I feel. Even 'I' is changed to ashes! Apr 29, 2010
    I look back at the day and in Your quietness, Beloved, I see my agitated mind and all the built illusions. Then all vanishes in silence. Apr 29, 2010
    Beyond external appearence of disorder is our thoughts' disorder. Beyond that, there is Order, Yours, my friend! Apr 28, 2010
    Man is frightened by disorder even if disorder is somewhat the core of human life. Disorder is what is versus what we think should be. Apr 28, 2010

    It is quite awkward that we tend to live our mental life through the writings of others. This is one cornerstone of conditionning. Apr 26, 2010
    Signs of conditionning: put too much hope in someone, in some ideology, in some dogma, etc., or in their absence, their denial. Apr 25, 2010
    Signs of conditionning in our thoughts: to feel trapped, closed, emprisonned, to think you have no choice, that the society makes it all... Apr 25, 2010
    Most of us think under conditionning. One of the first sign of it is to believe you worry when you are told what to worry about. Apr 25, 2010
    You are here and then You disappear from my sight. In despair, I seek for You to discover that You never ceased to be there, in everything. Apr 25, 2010
    My very self is burnt! I lost my words in a silent gaze! I lost myself in this mirror of your veils! Beloved, where is your worshipper? Apr 24, 2010
    Oh You, greatest of the great, You my friend in everything and beyond, let me burn in Your love! Let me love You till I'm consumed! Apr 24, 2010
    When I look inwardly, I see nothing. Except Your light that shines and reflects upon my rusty heart! Apr 24, 2010
    I sometimes wish there were no words to separate people. For words are illusions filling the heart with ideas instead of love. Apr 24, 2010
    Most of us desperately seek to be loved while their heart is not full of love. Love always and ask nothing in return! Apr 24, 2010

    The rainy night is bringing its pot of contingent water noises in which melts the singing of the hoot. Apr 23, 2010

    Without Love, there is nothing left around. Beloved, keep love in my heart! Apr 22, 2010
    On the path to God, there are deserts. I cross one of them right now, with a damaged 'I'. Apr 21, 2010
    I always knew there was noone inside me. If there can be a light, it comes from you, Beloved Friend. Apr 20, 2010
    I wish I could speak - but words are lost / I wish I could find back the pieces of me - but me is void Apr 20, 2010
    I feel weak and empty and words are flying out far from me. This is time for You to come closer. Apr 20, 2010
    Only You my friend can read the emptiness of my self, only filled with Your reflection. Apr 20, 2010
    Each time I speak, I realize I could abstain myself. Apr 20, 2010
    Maya is not a concept. It is real and it takes a while to understand it, see it, feel it. Apr 18, 2010
    To have a real exchange, you have to be two people listening to each other. This is quite hard to find. Apr 18, 2010
    In the silence of the night, my Friend, You are here, dancing with the worlds. Apr 17, 2010
    Contrary to what some people may think, false gurus are very useful: they show that some gurus can be true. Apr 17, 2010
    So many different paths lead to you, my Friend! And so many paths don't! Make me forget all intellectual burdens to be closer to You! Apr 17, 2010
    Our path towards the Divine is long and perilous, because there are so many obstacles in the way. Beloved Friend, accept my company! Apr 16, 2010
    If only the pure in intentions were to be religious men and women, there would be nobody in the temples. Apr 16, 2010

    It is not so obvious that the evil can come out of our actions. Most of us do not intend to be evil and nevertheless some of us are. Apr 11, 2010
    I did experience real evil on some rare occasions. Most of the time, it was just evil coming from unconscious silliness. Apr 11, 2010
    Intellectual concepts are a source of conflicts, because two people can never have the same mental representation of concepts. Apr 11, 2010
    Society must not be reduced to an intellectual concept. Society is made of the relationship there is between me and you. Apr 11, 2010
    We cannot reject society as it is. Rejection brings more conflict and closes the door of issue understanding. Apr 11, 2010
    It is rare to read things about God and to be inwardly sure they are harmless. Too often, religious standpoints are aggressive or dogmatic. Apr 11, 2010
    Le but, un dialogue avec le Cheikh : http://bit.ly/bildmU Apr 10, 2010
    When I see You, I see no more parts of You. When I see You, 'I' doesn't mean anything anymore. Apr 10, 2010
    My Beloved, You are the Constraint Maker and the One Who Frees minds and hearts. You are beyond all opposites. Help me polish my heart! Apr 09, 2010
    I am so imperfect when I look inside that I just cannot thank You enough for the feeling of Your mercy. Apr 09, 2010
    I said too many useless things, I thought so many silly things and did so many things I regret. Noone can see me as I do - except Thou. Apr 09, 2010
    Words are often so empty. And yet they can be so full of love, so deep that they feed our heart. Apr 09, 2010
    My sweet Friend, the contact with the material world is managed by your three gunas. Let me be untied by the three gunas. Apr 09, 2010
    There comes a moment in life when you discover how useless you are - except through the love you give. In this time, He is. Apr 05, 2010
    In French, an article about Jiddu Krishnamurti: http://bit.ly/bKkZ6v Mar 28, 2010
    Too many useless words spoken by too many verbose people. This won't change You, dearest friend. Mar 20, 2010

    What shadows could touch me when I am with You and the shadows of I became lights in your reflect? Mar 17, 2010
    In the cold night of the past day, the exhausted silence is full of Your blessing. Mar 17, 2010
    I don't want to add anything between us: just the space of a breath; just the time I forgets I to let the space to You. Mar 16, 2010
    I could weep a full ocean that it would not reimburse one second of what I owe You! Mar 16, 2010
    How much I love You, Beloved Friend! How near to my heart You are! Mar 16, 2010
    Beware to the multiple reflections of ego! When you stop seeing yourself everywhere, then you can see Him. Mar 16, 2010
    My Beloved, You are so smart that you make me laugh. You must admit You play with us sometimes! Mar 16, 2010
    Dearest Friend, Thou knowest that I only act as a present to Thou. But is it 'I' that is acting or Thou? Mar 16, 2010
    My love is You - my sins are me. Mar 16, 2010
    Lord, my Friend - forgive! Because no one else knows all my sins better than You do! Mar 16, 2010
    When you see reasoning in a saint text, you just see a mirror or yourself. Mar 16, 2010
    Apart from Love, there is Love. Apart from You, my dearest friend, there is You. How can I even think that I exist? Mar 13, 2010
    In the freezing night of the orange moon, close to my window, a owl is hooting in the silence. It praises the Beloved too. Mar 01, 2010
    Denial of reality is denial of truth. It is linked to denial of God and worship of the ego. It seems a common posture in Kali yuga's era. Mar 01, 2010
    You don't need books to meet the Great Friend, you just need your heart. Mar 01, 2010

    You can forget everything but monotheism. Feb 12, 2010
    Sufism is the path of balance between heart and mind. Feb 12, 2010
    The Beloved is within that very second. Feb 09, 2010
    Ego is one for all people, and not multiple. Feb 08, 2010
    When we speak, we know not. When we know, we speak not. Jan 29, 2010
    People do not want to know the truth. On the contrary, most of us want only to remain blind and deaf. Jan 24, 2010
    If we took the thoughts of others out of our minds, we would face void or creation. Jan 18, 2010
    Healing the body is not an outward concern, but an inward one. Jan 16, 2010
    People give outward advices to be well and live happily. I try to heal my numerous inward scars, praying you my Friend. Jan 16, 2010
    The more we speak, the more we lie or criticize or make mistakes or say untrue things. In silence, aphorisms are quite a long novel. Jan 16, 2010
    Long ago, I discovered I was not like the others. Now, I could not tell. Jan 16, 2010
    We should never count on what we gained, because all gain is an illusion. Jan 16, 2010
    People suffering is huge, even in people that convinced themselves they don't suffer. Jan 16, 2010
    If intellectual representations can make us see illusions rather than reality, emotions usually do the same. Jan 16, 2010
    In silence, Thou art, my beloved friend. Jan 15, 2010
    Amongst all that I have written, silence is best. Jan 15, 2010
    It is not so obvious that what we call 'our' thoughts really are ours. Dec 16, 2009
    We have to realize that error is linked to thinking and that it is an eternal truth. This implies that we should be humble in our thoughts. Dec 16, 2009
    In life, or you are a slave to someone, to some social structure, to some ideology, etc., or you are free through submission to the Beloved. Dec 09, 2009
    Men are slaves to their lies and fears and ideologies whereas the religious man is free. Dec 09, 2009
    The purpose of #philosophy is not to find out what men have thought but to find the truth of things. Saint Thomas Aquinas Dec 07, 2009
    Seeing what is requires some courage, because by assuming it, you will contradict those who live in a fantasy. Dec 07, 2009
    Our problem is that too often we refuse to see what is to prefer to think about what should be. Dec 07, 2009
    To distinguish the true from the false, one must cultivate #discernment. Dec 04, 2009
    Religion is like a jewel. There are so many fakes that pretend to be authentic. Dec 04, 2009
    Not every perverted form of religion can apply to all cultures. Dec 04, 2009
    Beloved, Your smile gives me strength. Dec 04, 2009
    #Romanticism is in Catholic countries an egocentric variation upon Christ's Passion. Dec 03, 2009
    #Intellect have always a dark side except if it is directed by #faith. Dec 02, 2009
    We must learn how to #act, because this is not obvious. We must learn what are absolute acts, acts that are not reactions but actions. Dec 01, 2009
    When an #act is done while waiting a reciprocity or a reward of any kind, then the act is not pure and not sincere. Dec 01, 2009
    Our main enemy was, is and will be #ego. This statement identifies a basic principle of #religion. Dec 01, 2009
    The way to get out of the action reaction chain is not to be attached to the fruits of our own actions. Dec 01, 2009
    We always pay the consequences of our own acts, because we are submitted to the action reaction chain. Dec 01, 2009
    We must fight against the patterns of thought that are inside our minds and that produce already thought conclusions. Dec 01, 2009
    The cult of #God must not turn into the cult of #ego. It happens when people believe God is only immanent and not transcendent. Dec 01, 2009
    Blessed be all the ones that worship Thou, my Friend! Nov 23, 2009
    There are so many ways the #Shaytan is messing with people's mind: his name is Legion and your name, Beloved, is #One. Nov 23, 2009
    In the starry cold night, I pray You, Beloved Friend, and sometimes I pray you so much that 'I' disappear in You! Alhamdulillah! Nov 22, 2009
    To breathe spiritually, we need space inwardly. Nov 22, 2009
    Love is a space where there is no measurement. Nov 22, 2009
    If we promote measure, then our god should be the computer. It is much better than we to #measure. Nov 22, 2009
    Intellect does not appreciate, does not taste nor feel: it measures. The path is not to #measure anymore. Nov 22, 2009
    Manhood invented lots of tricks to forget to be living. Most of us are experts in avoidance. Nov 22, 2009
    We are so empty that we continuously crave for filling our brain with someone else's thoughts. Nov 22, 2009
    When we are emotionally attached to some past memory, we usually react badly to a new fact concerning that very #memory. Nov 21, 2009
    Real #revolution of the mind happens when we see the facts as they are. Nov 21, 2009
    We should learn to distinguish between opinion and truth. Nov 21, 2009
    Hoarding always generates troubles. Nov 21, 2009
    We must forgot experiences, by fear of being bound to live the present instant through the memories of what it looks like. Nov 20, 2009
    Thou art One for my #heart and Thou appears to me as many for my #mental. Nov 19, 2009
    Getting out of the net of causes and consequences is first of all a psychological labor. Nov 19, 2009
    The clarification of intentions is a primer concern for the religious man. Nov 19, 2009
    Truth is is truth anymore when it is said cynically or to hurt. Nov 19, 2009
    So many suffering from the past keeps on living inside us and influencing our actions: this is #Maya. Nov 19, 2009
    We can ask ourselves if there is a #path. This question is irrelevant. There is no path but one step. And, a posteriori, steps are a path. Nov 19, 2009
    #Ego is too often everywhere, inwardly for sure, but too often, we project it outwardly too. Nov 18, 2009
    To move on the #spiritual path, we have to avoid projecting our ego in every person we meet. Nov 18, 2009
    We have a tendency to melt #pure with impure things. This tendency can vanish progressively like disappearing veils. Nov 18, 2009
    If we could speak not when we do not know, the world would be more peaceful. Nov 18, 2009
    We should be tolerant about the use of words, because even if you seem to say the reverse of what I say, we could mean the same thing. Nov 17, 2009
    A lot of debates are only centered upon words, but not upon meaning. Nov 17, 2009
    Tradition does not exist strictly speaking. But let's say that eternal wisdom could be called tradition. Nov 17, 2009
    When we try to turn things as they are into things as they should be, we create new issues to be added to the ones that were there already. Nov 17, 2009
    Whether we want or don't want, things occur anyway. Nov 17, 2009
    Novelty is always illusion of the manifold. Nov 17, 2009
    The more we speak about the #spiritual, the more it vanishes. Nov 17, 2009
    When we see differences in things, we are not being spiritual. Nov 17, 2009
    Truth is not hidden, but we don't want to see it. We prefer our known confortable lies and escapes to it. The one who doesn't is #religious. Nov 15, 2009
    When we have to face the truth brutally, we generally escape into two kinds of behavior: #denial or doing as if nothing occurred. Nov 15, 2009
    The human mind has a limited number of thinking patterns. Those patterns are the basis of our #conditioning. Nov 14, 2009
    "Take out the rush from the weave and there will be no name and no shape left." Sheikh Ahmad Al-Alawi Nov 13, 2009
    Beyond the immense loneliness that pushes us to run away from life in desires and pleasures begins the domain of the Beloved. Nov 13, 2009
    Even if we are continuously trying to #master things, we often don't realize we don't master anything. Nov 13, 2009
    Sometimes, we would like to express, then don't find the words, then remain silent. In this state, we don't lie anymore. Nov 13, 2009
    The round dance of the world is always running, on and on. Nov 13, 2009
    Humanity needs to be reassured, physically first, but also in a psychological way. This is this need that leads to #conformism. Nov 13, 2009
    Why are we endlessly #quoting other people? Perhaps because it is reassuring not to think by oneself? Nov 13, 2009
    So many of us are lost in useless social questions that prevent us to search for the beloved. Nov 12, 2009
    #Society is not an abstract concept: it is only the set of my relationships with the people I interact with. Nov 12, 2009
    If you think you know the #Truth, realize this is an indication you don't. Nov 11, 2009
    Thinking through #clusters of ideas provides the illusion of thinking freely while the cluster drives the thoughts like a prison. Nov 11, 2009
    Ideas and ideologies go by #clusters. Thus, it is common to meet people that think in clusters. Nov 11, 2009
    Rather than protection through isolation, protection can be found through non resistance, but a non resistance without object. Nov 11, 2009
    Happiness lies in the world of opposite. As a matter of fact, we cannot target #happiness without getting the opposite. Nov 11, 2009
    To go to Him, we must know ourselves, so our mind, so our #ego, so our intellect. When we see all that, it remains a #heart to polish. Nov 10, 2009
    There are nor beginning nor end. This are just steps in the #present time. Nov 10, 2009
    We are too afraid of #failure and all what this word means. Failure is a judgment while #error is a #fact. Let us stick to the fact. Nov 10, 2009
    As children, we all make #errors, continuously, and fail on the path. But Beloved, your forgiving Highness helps us to move forward. Nov 10, 2009
    One day, every person is facing a choice : going on outwardly into pleasure seeking (even delicate ones) or seeking inwardly for the #Truth. Nov 10, 2009
    The most the #pleasure is subtle, the larger the pain is when this pleasure is not there. That's why wise men are simple. Nov 10, 2009
    #Thought, even if we think it is personal, is a common attribute of humankind. That means we all think and too often the same things. Nov 10, 2009
    Beyond manifestation is #love. Nov 10, 2009
    The walls outside are just the reflection of the inward walls. Nov 10, 2009
    When You, Beloved, are here, I do not exist anymore. Nov 09, 2009
    The Beloved is in all hearts. Some have just too must rust over their #heart to see God's reflection upon it. Nov 09, 2009
    We must not despise any #religion because in themselves they have the same #heart, the same impulse of mankind towards Him. Nov 09, 2009
    The relationship to the #guide must not be based on authority but on mutual trust, as two friends making a step towards the Beloved. Nov 09, 2009
    The #spiritual path is one of the most dangerous journeys ever because of the number of different traps one has to avoid while following it. Nov 08, 2009
    Seeing the world as it is is the first step to stop projecting what it could or should be. Nov 07, 2009
    #Spiritual things take a long time to infuse beyond words and intellectual apprehension. Nov 07, 2009
    Saying there is no #method does not mean we cannot be guided but means that #guidance cannot be reduced to imitation. Nov 07, 2009
    We cannot say there is no #path because each of us has a path. Nov 07, 2009
    A creative mind does not pursue #creation; it just 'occurs'. Nov 06, 2009
    We must not confuse #creation as a capture of the spirit of the time with a creative mind. Nov 06, 2009
    #Respectability and #conformity are not compliant with the spirit of the #religious man. Nov 06, 2009
    Rare are the people with no #heart, but they are. Nov 06, 2009
    In so many written words, one must follow his #heart silently instead of saturating his head. Nov 06, 2009
    There are often #pure ways of acting, but those ways do not involve #intellect. Nov 06, 2009
    All things lead to the One. That is why some people use the word #path. Nov 06, 2009
    The outward wars and conflicts are the result of the continuous inward #war and #conflict. Nov 06, 2009
    'I' can talk about #ego. Nov 05, 2009
    #Duality is the world of men, Oneness is the #path to God. Nov 05, 2009
    Overcoming the #duality leads to the #One. Nov 05, 2009
    #Love is not the negation of #hate. Nov 05, 2009
    The process of #becoming is bringing inward conflict as outward conflict. Becoming should be choice-less. Nov 05, 2009
    #Negative #understanding can be the highest level of understanding in life, provided it is a negative without opposite. Nov 05, 2009
    When we are in the #negative approach, we often are in reaction to something. The #referential is still the one of the something. Nov 05, 2009
    Non action is not the negative of #action. It is the substance of action. Nov 05, 2009
    #Authority only relies on the fact that one people will order and one will obey. If one of them is not acting, the illusion breaks down. Nov 05, 2009
    Things are done by themselves. That means that non action is somewhat the real #action. Nov 05, 2009
    The #ego is a subtle illusion that is revivified if we fight against it. Nov 05, 2009
    We only learn when investigating about ourselves. The rest is useless accumulation of intellectual #knowledge. Nov 04, 2009
    #Spiritual words are odd: they do not speak to the ones that are deaf, and the ones they speak to do not need them. Nov 04, 2009
    The objective of man is to be #free. That is throughout this #freedom that man can 'meet' 'God'. Nov 04, 2009
    We must break free from family first because this cell is too often the origin of belonging, of division and conflict. Nov 04, 2009
    Rejecting #authority is an inward behaviour before it manifests. It begins with parents ang ego. Nov 04, 2009
    Acts should be done with no particular reason, just because things must be done, without the intellect to confuse things as they are. Nov 03, 2009
    If you want to #free yourself 'from', then you will never be free. Except if you free yourself 'from' #ego. Nov 03, 2009
    #Freedom is not 'having the choice'. Freedom is not a relative state. Nov 03, 2009
    There is no #authority, no #leader, no #guru, no #ideal, no #theory, no #method, etc. And this is not small talk. Nov 03, 2009
    #Wisdom has nothing to do with age or experience or intellectual #knowledge. Wisdom is seeing what is. Nov 03, 2009
    Being #wise is not being stuck into one's experience. It is seeing the truth with no judgement. Nov 03, 2009
    The #ego likes to act like a child or a player. That is why so many aged people are not wise but childish. Nov 03, 2009
    Comparison is measure in a reactive way. It is a cause of conflict. Nov 03, 2009
    Measure is a representation. Indeed it is not the thing measured but a judgement. Nov 03, 2009
    Being born as a religious person means being dead for the #ego. Nov 03, 2009
    Measurement is the core function of our intellect. When measure disappear, the religious person can be born. Nov 03, 2009
    When you don't accept lies (personal, social, etc.), when you stick to the truth, respectable people will treat you as a madman. Nov 03, 2009
    If something is represented whereas it should not be, then it can become easily #ideology, and so cause conflict and pain. Nov 03, 2009
    Our supposed creations are not creations but at most the expression of some talent. To be #creative, one need to be #free. Nov 03, 2009
    Is there a #path to #spiritual matters? Probably the 'not not' method of the ancient #rishis - which is not a path by the way. Nov 03, 2009
    The world of opposites is far from the #truth because it is the world of opinions. Opinions have no importance at all in #spiritual matters. Nov 03, 2009
    With some people, what they say is the contrary to what you should understand. In their mouth, 'peace and love' means 'war and hate'. Nov 03, 2009
    The #ego wants to live in a securing illusion about himself. This is because the truth is not acceptable to the mind. Nov 03, 2009
    When we say someone is #mad, we often project our undigested #madness over this person. Nov 03, 2009
    The bigger an #ego is, the blinder the person is. This blindness prevents the person to understand other people's reactions towards her. Nov 03, 2009
    Our #ego is living in an illusion and not in the real world. Because our ego does not want to see the truth but reassuring illusions. Nov 03, 2009
    The more we would need to take conscience of what is wrong inwardly, the more we are unable to do that. This is mechanical. Nov 03, 2009
    People who would need to change are often the people that can't. Nov 02, 2009
    Why say we are afraid of the unknown? If it is unknown, we cannot be afraid. We are afraid about the known that left bad memories. Nov 02, 2009
    Our vision of the world is always limited by our knowledge of ourselves. Nov 02, 2009
    The need for security is the root of a #confusion: needing security outwardy is a need of man while inwardly it is the source of #conflict. Nov 02, 2009
    We are generally full of habits and quick to make new habits. This #fact comes from the inward urge for security of #mankind. Nov 02, 2009
    If we have the intention to become, then we are taken into the net of #causation. Nov 02, 2009
    #Karma's law is one door to the search for the permanent, for what escapes to #causation. Nov 01, 2009
    In the #Vedas, #time, #space and #causation are the rules of #Maya, the wall between the manifested world and the One. Nov 01, 2009
    All that has a #cause can end. All that has no cause is an attribute of the divine. Nov 01, 2009
    We can see clearly when the #mind is not to filled with daily worries. Then, in this void comes true #intelligence. Nov 01, 2009
    That is not because we think logically that we are intelligent. This #fact explains why so much thouhts are useless. Nov 01, 2009
    It is wrong to believed that #intelligence is related to #culture and #knowledge, even to thinking. Nov 01, 2009
    Inward #space can come by observing inwardly the technical #knowledge decompose itself and vanish. Oct 31, 2009
    Inward #space cannot come through a method which is always the application of an intellectual #pattern tied to reward and punishment. Oct 31, 2009
    All the conditioning elements of the mind can be transformed by the #heart provided there is #space inwardly. Oct 31, 2009
    Structured religions dogmas are a sample of intellectual #knowledge. The words must be transformed by the heart to be useful. Oct 31, 2009
    When we say #knowledge, we mean intellectual accumulation of other's thoughts. This kind of knowledge is only imitation and cannot create. Oct 31, 2009
    #Order is not always the contrary of disorder. Order is an #attribute of the One. Oct 31, 2009
    When we inquire into #education, we are facing the problem of knowledge. Is knowledge for man is being like a database? Full of sorted data? Oct 31, 2009
    #Education can be seen at various levels. Too often, educators only see the technical side of it, the one that will enable you to get a job. Oct 31, 2009
    If #education consists in filling our brain with other's ideas, then we should ask ourselves if there is another kind of education. Oct 31, 2009
    Modern #education twisted the relationship between people. Depending on your education, you are honored or despised. Oct 31, 2009
    If we only react to things, then obviously we are not free. Considering that reaction is conditionned, we can be seen as 'asleep'. Oct 31, 2009
    There are two kinds of actions: the reaction is the action that has a cause; the action with no cause. Seek the second. Oct 31, 2009
    We need no dogma to be religious persons because true religion is speechless. Oct 31, 2009
    Idealism has the enormous disadvantage of belonging to the referential of opposites. So no form of idealism can lead to the One. Oct 31, 2009
    When something happens, we ask 'why' as if we were taking as granted the fact that there is actually a cause to everything. Oct 30, 2009
    Entertainment is way to run away from what is. It implies always a projection out of what is, above all psychologically. Oct 30, 2009
    We are made of the dead. Everywhere around us, there are remains of our dead ancestors. We call it 'dust', but we are made of their dust. Oct 30, 2009
    We are made of what we eat and drink. In a sense, it is a great lie to say 'my' body. Oct 30, 2009
    Why do we always want more? Why can't we correlate the ambition of having more and the pain to get it, to keep it or to never get it? Oct 30, 2009
    We need to be very careful about words, because the word is not the thing. Taking words too seriously can lead to awful mistakes. Oct 30, 2009
    Isolation of the self appears to bring protection when it can only bring conflict through separation. This #truth is hard to really feel. Oct 30, 2009
    #Hinduism allows the individual path in the religious way whereas other religions do not. For sure, inward investigation is still needed. Oct 30, 2009
    There are many #path to true religion. Strangely, some are going into it through dogma, and others with no dogma at all. Oct 30, 2009
    If we decide to investigate inwardly, then we can examine the causes. It is no #metaphysical game because some facts are causeless. Oct 30, 2009
    If there is a cause, then the cause can disappear. There is no cause for love, for intelligence, for truth. Oct 30, 2009
    The hindu notion of Maya is more than the world seen as an illusion. Maya is the complex trap in which we are caught before awakening. Oct 30, 2009
    'What is' is now. When we are becoming, we enter of a psychologic time which is a construction of the mind, a projection of what should be. Oct 30, 2009
    We learn to know ourselves in observing the mirror of the relation to other beings, things, ideas and so on. Oct 29, 2009
    The need to be near to saints is comprehensible for people that have religious feelings. All the issue lies in the meaning of 'to be near'. Oct 29, 2009
    Empty my self from myself: this is the target of Sufism. Know yourself and you will know God. Oct 28, 2009
    The religious man cannot accept any authority and he should be ready to leave his beliefs behind. Oct 28, 2009
    Real religion is beyond dogma. Oct 28, 2009
    One of the most deep notion of hinduism is the law of Karma. It takes a great deal to go into it and discover the nature of it. Oct 28, 2009
    You cannot force someone into real religion. You cannot attract someone to real religion. This attraction is like love: here or not here. Oct 28, 2009
    Ambition is the will to be something that we are not. Ambition is a form of intention. Fasting inward meaning is fasting of intentions. Oct 28, 2009
    Representation is mandatory due to language. But representation does not speak the truth but just a caricature of it. Oct 28, 2009
    If mankind could change by an intellectual system, it would have long time ago. Oct 28, 2009
    Wanting to change manhood directly supposes manhood can be changed by the direct influence of man. This is not a #fact but an illusion. Oct 28, 2009
    When we think about society, we should begin to think about our own actions between each other rather than discussing intellectual opinions. Oct 28, 2009
    We could feel betrayed by our leaders whatever the kind of authority they endorse. Because authority is, in a sense, lie and betrayal. Oct 26, 2009
    Indeed 'I' is ego. Ego is dividing the mind between observer and observed whereas there is no valid split but just thought. Oct 25, 2009
    Consciousness and thouht are not our personal properties. What remains when we take out of ego what is not 'I'? Oct 25, 2009
    Thought is a common asset. To make thought a personal asset is a trick of the ego. It is only seeing the surface of things. Oct 25, 2009
    Perhaps conditionning is not enough to describe how impersonal consciousness can be. There may be abstract thinking patterns also. Oct 25, 2009
    When we realize we all think the same things at the same moment, we should question the concept of 'personal consciousness'. Oct 25, 2009
    Conflict is always useless. However, we should not avoid conflict but learn what conflict really is. Oct 24, 2009
    Isolation is the counterpart of ego: it creates conflict. Oct 24, 2009
    Cause and effect are in the center of psychological time. When that time is seen as it is, causation can disappear. Oct 24, 2009
    Craving for security inwardly brings conflict mandatorily inwrdly and outwardly. Oct 22, 2009
    World's confusion is just the outward illustration of humanity's inward confusion. Oct 21, 2009
    When I say I, I lie to myself by splitting myself into observer and observed. Indeed, ego is the primal form of neurosis. Oct 21, 2009
    We shiuld learn to feel that the word is not the thing, and that the word is a trap of no reality. Oct 21, 2009
    Everyone of us may have thousands of opinions. But opinion does not matter at all. Opinon is second hand thought with no reality. Oct 21, 2009
    The mean is the real end because the end is only a mental thought, an excuse for employing the mean in the present. Oct 21, 2009
    We are trained to distinguish the mean from the end. This distinction is not real. The fact is the mean is the end. Oct 21, 2009
    Many people question tools as if their purpose was restricted to some uses or some archetypal people. But a tool is a mean. Oct 21, 2009
    We have to question the urge of men to `belong´, as we have to question the urge of being `guided´. Oct 21, 2009
    One fact is that men never knew any psychologic progress for thousands of years. Technology changed but humanity did not. Oct 21, 2009
    Attention is somewhere the alternate path to thinking. This is where understanding is born. Oct 20, 2009
    Religious matters generally hide the real meankng of things, some comprehension that cannot be expressed by words. Other matters are void. Oct 20, 2009
    Intellect is dividing, classifying, analyzing and so on. This is adapted for mechanical things comprehension but not for life. Oct 20, 2009
    Inward space is required to be free. When the mind is filled with thoughts, there is no space inside to be free. Oct 20, 2009
    Unsatisfaction is the key to self knowledge. But unsatisfaction which comes with no 'about'. Oct 19, 2009
    Searching the truth has no meaning when one expects to find something. The search must be aimless. Indeed it is not really a search. Oct 19, 2009
    The point is not to say too much or to say too little, but to speak the truth, this being a long or short while, or silence. Oct 19, 2009
    The point seems not to detach but more to be able to look at attachment to understand how it really works. Oct 19, 2009
    Conformity is the consequence of relation to authority. We cannot know ourselves if we conform to any kind of model. Oct 19, 2009
    The ambition to become is generating pain and conflicts. This movement is an illustration of the separation of the mind. Oct 19, 2009
    Why being a second hand thinker by recycling other's thoughts when we can try to find out by our own attention and vision ? Oct 18, 2009
    Isolation is a constant of man. Isolation causes conflict. Isolation is the way the mind usually works. Oct 18, 2009
    Indeed, even though evolution can be seen in the material world, our mind never evolved. It s the same as 50 000 years ago. Oct 18, 2009
    We should go into the concept of tribe. Even if tribes should have disappear, westill have tribal minds. Oct 18, 2009
    We usually think our thoughts are ours, but that is not true. Thoughts are humanity's. Oct 18, 2009
    Verbal or intellectual understanding leads to illusion and false knowledge because it is theoretical knowledge. Oct 18, 2009
    The mind is always seeking security. But security for the mind implies conflict outside. Oct 18, 2009
    Conforming to standards streches the mind as all respect to an authority does. Oct 18, 2009
    Misunderstanding can be the salt of our false analysis of the other. To be able to understand the other, we must be him and to feel what is. Aug 01, 2009
    We usually search for pleasures. One of the pleasures is to be read and to feel someone. This is Maya. Aug 01, 2009
    Wisdom can be hidden right before your eyes. But, you don't want to listen because hearing the truth is no pleasure. Aug 01, 2009
    Denial is the best way to alter what is. For sure, as it is not philosophy, it cannot be wisdom. Aug 01, 2009
    Twitter may not be something for me after all. Going back to my cave. Bye guyz. Jul 31, 2009
    With thoughts, we can demonstrate everything and its opposite. This is because inference is never pure from our ego and our conditioning. Jul 30, 2009
    Believe in Truth, practice the Truth, speak the Truth. Wisdom begins here: in the Truth. Jul 30, 2009
    The thinker cannot see another way of living exists that through the thoughts. He tries to imagine the possibles and can't see what is. Jul 24, 2009
    This is a fact that the more you have knowledge, the stronger your ego is. Jul 19, 2009
    The scholar is attached to knowledge like the rich is attached to the material posessions. And knowledge ties even more than things. Jul 19, 2009
    The scholar does not think by himself but only in reference to the other's thoughts. That's why he cannot get rid of thoughts. Jul 19, 2009
    Knowledge and wisdom are going in two different directions. The wise man can get rid of knowledge whereas the scholar cannot get wisdom. Jul 19, 2009
    Action is a complex thing to understand. We try to enslave action to ideology whereas action can only be in freedom. Jul 15, 2009
    Thought is a good tool for common life but it should be limited to certain areas. For others, thought is a poison blinding us. Jul 15, 2009
    Action should not be the result of the thought, or action takes place in the referential of the past. If this is, the unknown cannot happen. Jul 15, 2009
    In the relationship, we think we can get things from others. But there is a space where gaining something has no meaning anymore. Jul 15, 2009
    Melancoly is living in the past. It is easy for mankind because the thought is located in the past. Indeed, the thought is the past. Jul 15, 2009
    Even if we all speak the same words, we never mean the same things when using those same words. Beware of the word which is not the thing. Jul 15, 2009
    I am happy not to teach. Jul 15, 2009
    We are full of dreams and imagination. But this cannot stand for reality. Jul 15, 2009
    Some will say I am wise. Some will say I am mad. Whatever. If only they knew that 'I' don't really is. Jul 14, 2009
    No theory can make you better, no practice. Just calm down and feel what is. Jul 14, 2009
    Perceiving what is enables to shut down the ego and to unite inwardly. Jul 14, 2009
    Several plans are existing in ourselves. When we reach the core of us, we discover the Void. Jul 14, 2009
    Real experience is perceiving what is. This perception brings no accumulation. The past moment dies immediately. Jul 14, 2009
    We think in order to have experiences in the known. All those theories about the the world are just here to hide our fear from what is. Jul 14, 2009
    If we can see the mind as it is, then all thoughts are vanishing. Jul 14, 2009
    Sex has become very important because it is the only way mankind can free for a moment from the mind. Jul 14, 2009
    For ages, we are searching for the truth. But if we have an opinion on what we will find, we only search for a projection of ourselves. Jul 14, 2009
    When we talk about love, we should use other words. Because love is rare whereas attachment, fusion, possession are common. Jul 13, 2009
    Culture is a burden for the mind. Most of people have read too many books. They are just quoting. Jul 13, 2009
    Mankind knows so well how to copy, dreams so badly about what to become. But who really is? Jul 13, 2009
    When you listen to an intelligent man, you try to be as he is. It is not intelligence but copy. We are raised upon copying. Jul 13, 2009
    Mankind should look at all the things that did not work in the past and try to avoid them. Then the path to reality would open. Jul 13, 2009
    To be wise, people should look at the idiots. Because looking at intelligent people is a stupid thing making you stupid. Jul 13, 2009
    No theory can cope with reality. That's why we usually prefer theories to what is. Jul 13, 2009
    Things can change if we have no will to change them. Changing things by will is a cause of conflict. Jul 13, 2009
    What is cannot be a problem. It is. If what is is a problem, this is because the problem is inside us. Jul 13, 2009
    In the sphere of thought, there are only false problems and false answers. Jul 13, 2009
    Teaching other's thoughts is a strange idea when we know we should teach how to get rid of other's thoughts. Jul 13, 2009
    Our ego is so full of himself that we think we can be original. But ego, like thoughts, cannot be original. Jul 12, 2009
    The first error we make is thinking that we have personal thoughts whereas thousands of people think what we think. Jul 12, 2009
    Thought is material. Jul 11, 2009
    It is not sure that we really evolve; on the contrary, we could evolve badly by accumulating too many material things in our minds. Jul 11, 2009
    Ambition is one of the source of conflict as becoming is. Is there a way to live out of ambition and becoming? Jul 11, 2009
    When we cannot see facts as they are, we argue about the fact that truth is relative. Jul 05, 2009
    Mankind has a huge experience in creating escapes from what is. Imagination is one of them. Jul 05, 2009
    We are all, at one point in our life, facing the issue of finding what we are. Most of us escape from that question. Jul 05, 2009
    Truth is not hidden, but so many of us decided not to search for it. Jul 05, 2009
    We often have the illusion of wanting to change things. Indeed, we want things to change to get more pleasure from them. Not change, desire. Jul 04, 2009
    We should ask ourselves if it is normal to manage relationships psychologically as we manage technical things in our lives. Jul 04, 2009
    We should be more careful about the self proclaimed experts. Instead of unveiling things, they usually put people into darkness. Jul 04, 2009
    Obeying to an authority is always a trade : freedom for a material gain such as money, position, reputation, power, etc. Jul 04, 2009
    Lots of us criticize war, but we are doing it in our very daily life, inwardly and outwardly, through our ambition and our egotism. Jul 02, 2009
    Inward confusion is coming from the battle of thoughts and the fight of contradictory desires. Jul 02, 2009
    Action that is coming after thought is not the appropriate action. Jul 02, 2009
    Nothing exists but what is in the present. There are no such things as past and future. Jul 02, 2009
    Thinking is our psychological time. As personal thinking is an illusion, time is also a construction of the mind. Jul 02, 2009
    Thinking takes place in the present but is never related to the present but always to the past. Jul 02, 2009
    Illusion begins by thinking that 'we' think. Jul 02, 2009
    When we pretend to think by our own, we'd better be sure that habit, society, experience, tradition, etc. is not the thinker. Jul 02, 2009
    We have to be very attentive about the way we think. Because we usually think we have personal opinions whereas it is not true. Jul 02, 2009
    So many if us consciously prefer to live in an illusion. We think the illusion protects whereas it is the root of pain. Jul 02, 2009
    We feed in books, from the experience of others of from ours. But we never take the time to really talk about what life is. Jul 02, 2009
    Few people, instead of criticizing, are able to lead people to take conscience of what they really did and that they cannot see. Jul 01, 2009
    The question, once formulated, is a trap made by its very words. Jul 01, 2009
    Asking a question is already formulating a problem in a certain way. Answering is closing the door. This is representation, not what is. Jul 01, 2009
    Question and answer is an illustration of duality. Can this really be in that direction that truth is? Jul 01, 2009
    We may ask ourselves the same questions, but we may not have the same answers. Indeed, we might have no answer at all. Jul 01, 2009
    We cannot deny that mankind has unsolved questions, perhaps because no answer is totally satisfying. Jul 01, 2009
    Listen to the noise of the world, which is the noise within, and be attentive to this moment out of time. Jun 30, 2009
    Are we able to stop doing things for a while in order to get out of confusion? Jun 30, 2009
    For the ones who discovered reality, there is no need to express it. the reason is simple: expressing it is loosing it. Jun 30, 2009
    If I can formulate a law, this law is not true. Truth cannot be formulated easily because it always changes. Jun 30, 2009
    We are never suspicious enough about our thoughts. Jun 30, 2009
    The spiritual path is full of traps, the first one being perhaps to believe that it exists. Jun 30, 2009
    A lot of people are talking about the other's mistakes. But can we face the fact that we are mistaken too? Jun 30, 2009
    Fighting with one another has no meaning of the ego is not there. Jun 30, 2009
    We are all in search for security and love, in a certain extent. This research shows itself in what should be versus what is. Jun 30, 2009
    Non action is a valid action when circumstances are obviously absurd. Jun 30, 2009
    With aggregated experience, the mind narrows because it is not able to accept anymore what is without attaching the fact to the known. Jun 29, 2009
    We are the conclusion we made about life. The more we conclude, the more we are dying, inwardly. Jun 29, 2009
    Some of us think we must have an idea before acting. But, what if there were no correlation between action and idea? Jun 29, 2009
    We are used to assimilate wrongly, happiness, joy, comfort and pleasure. Jun 29, 2009
    We can see the depth of our conditionning when we begin to discuss life, thinking and concepts. Jun 29, 2009
    Most of people that want to guide others are not correctly guided themselves. They want to show the direction but have no idea of it. Jun 29, 2009
    When we accept what is by being attentive to it, the very notion of issue diseappear, so does the contradiction. Jun 28, 2009
    When there is comparison, there is conflict, confusion. Comparison is always relative, so far from truth. Jun 28, 2009
    We are so much and so little at the same time that we should understand that measure is not the proper way to base our thoughts. Jun 28, 2009
    When self confidence is, it can be a way to seeing things as they are, so without the self. Jun 28, 2009
    To get rid of the self, we first need a little of self confidence, even if we may be bound to feel about what this is. Jun 28, 2009
    One of the problems of philosophy is considering that the word is the thing. Indeed it is not. Jun 28, 2009
    We have too often the tendency to reduce the unknown to the known. This leaves us unsatisfied as we close out the perception of what is. Jun 27, 2009
    Reputation does not mean value, freedom or truth, in politics as in philosophy. Jun 26, 2009
    If we dig sufficiently into conditioning, we can understand manipulation. Jun 26, 2009
    Medias, politicians, preachers and philosophers would like to lead us. Accepting their authority turns us into pretended guided robots. Jun 26, 2009
    it is not so obvious that we know how to think. Thinking may be first knowing what thinking really is. Jun 26, 2009
    Most of the times, when we think we are thinking, we are manipulated. Or by others, or by our own past. Jun 26, 2009
    Religion can hide personal paths, itineraries of freedom that do not belong to and are often falsely attributed to some tradition. Jun 26, 2009
    Most of us are or looking forward or looking backwards, but cannot be attentive to what is. This is why there is conflict inwardly. Jun 26, 2009
    Observer and observed are one single entity. That is why all self judgement are irrelevant. Jun 26, 2009
    It is said that love is blind whereas it is the reverse; vision can only be through the heart and never through the mind. Jun 24, 2009
    In order to reveal what is, some of us can use some help. Help of love first, then some very few books may act as mirrors. Jun 24, 2009
    We cannot change. We can only reveal what is and accept it. Jun 24, 2009
    If you seek the truth, begin by seeking where no one is looking. Jun 24, 2009
    Conditioning is dangerous to the mind because it leads to being manipulated. Jun 24, 2009
    Is it so important to ensure remote uncertain truth when inward truth, the closest one, is unknown? Jun 24, 2009
    So many people consider true so many facts that are impossible for them to verify. Jun 24, 2009
    We are sponges absorbing good and bad influences. One day, we have to flush all the inward stagnating influences to clean our heart out. Jun 23, 2009
    The absence of thinking is not the absence of consciousness. It is the contrary and is called differently depending on times and places. Jun 23, 2009
    The more we think, the less we solve important issues. Thinking shows that there is conflict inwardly. Jun 23, 2009
    We usually trust thought, but when things work, thought is often totally out of them. Jun 23, 2009
    We are used to think naturally. But we are not used to ask ourselves about what thinking really is. Jun 23, 2009
    Some say there is no path. Some say there is a path. I suspect all say the same but not from the same perspective. Jun 23, 2009
    When we try to be what we are not, there is conflict. When we are what we are, we can foresee that it is not obvious that we are. Jun 23, 2009
    We should never judge others knowing how similar we are from the one we judge. Jun 21, 2009
    It is incredible how many lies we can tell in a day prentending telling the truth. Jun 21, 2009
    Being attentive must not mean saying 'I am conscious that I'm doing that'. Being attentive is observing the 'I'. Jun 20, 2009
    Even if we pretend to communicate, we are still lonely, above all within all this technology. Jun 20, 2009
    There is the one in solitude, the one which is seeing inward loneliness and the isolated. Those are three different states. Jun 20, 2009
    So many gurus tried to isolate themselves from the world, but they were taking with them the accumulated knowledge of society. Jun 20, 2009
    Loneliness is a inward state we must be aware of. It is not solitude but the fact or seeing that inwardly there is just ourselves. Jun 20, 2009
    Fear is the center of our psyche. Fear of losing what we accumulated so greedily, fear of not being loved anymore, fear of loneliness. Jun 20, 2009
    As we are afraid of becoming our own guru, we seek gurus outside whereas we could be both guru and disciple. Jun 20, 2009
    Habits are mindkillers. When we go into habits, our attention fades. Morale and principles are replacing what is. Jun 20, 2009
    Sometimes in life we have to figure out wether we like truth or security most. Jun 20, 2009
    It is so easy to tell someone what he or she wants to hear, and so hard to tell the truth people never want to hear. Jun 20, 2009
    Mankind has always wanted to last. The projection in the future is an escape from what is in order to have a guarantee on what will be. Jun 20, 2009
    When love is, thought is not, time is not. There is just love. Jun 19, 2009
    Affliction can be so hard when we pursue an impossible target. Seeing what is allow to calm down affliction. Jun 19, 2009
    Don't fill your heart with theories, or you will become the theory. Unless the theory is a way to hide yourself behind other's thoughts. Jun 19, 2009
    If we were not so attached by our little possessions, we could love. But the heart is so often full of useless lifeless items. Jun 19, 2009
    The world never lacked intelligence, but it lacked love. Jun 19, 2009
    Thoughts are full of dogmas. One of the wicked dogmas of thoughts is the cult of thought. Jun 19, 2009
    Freedom is beginning by inward freedom, and so by getting rid of dogmas. Jun 19, 2009
    Love comes with freedom. That's why so many people only think they love whereas they want to own, to possess. Jun 19, 2009
    In love, there is no time anymore. Jun 19, 2009
    Most of us crave for love and security whereas those two things are not compatible. Jun 19, 2009
    We must not confuse loving and searching the security of the love of another. Jun 19, 2009
    To feel love, we must leave the hiding or avoiding spirit that lies in thought. Jun 18, 2009
    I saw today an amazing look. Jun 18, 2009
    To feel love, we must give up all theories. Jun 18, 2009
    Discovering love is the greatest thing in life. It means clearing the barriers of self protection. Jun 18, 2009
    We have to know what we mean by love. Love is an easy word to say but who knows really what love is? Jun 18, 2009
    Wanting to change is creating a discrepancy between what is and what should be. We only change by seing what is. Jun 17, 2009
    The is always a reason for us not to see what is. Knowing that reason is the beginning of self knowledge. Jun 16, 2009
    We are only afraid about our fantasies because there is no reason to be afraid of what is. Jun 16, 2009
    If we cannot see the reality, we are in the fantasies of our thought. Jun 16, 2009
    When we follow a guru, we are not free, whoever or whatever the guru can be. Jun 15, 2009
    When we wee ourselves from the outside, we can wish we were different. But this illusion is putting us in the dead end of what should be. Jun 15, 2009
    Talking about yourself is often irrelevant. Jun 14, 2009
    The more you know about yourself, the less you talk about you. Jun 14, 2009
    The issue of social rebellion is that it remains full of the current world paradigms. Jun 14, 2009
    Being for a theory or being against is exactly the same sterile movement. Jun 14, 2009
    Why hysteria has become a standard? Jun 13, 2009
    When we realize that the purpose is only an idea, and idea is past, we can focus on being attentive to the present. Jun 13, 2009
    We should let the things do by themselves sometimes instead of wanting to control them. Jun 13, 2009
    We look forward too often instead of living now through what is. Jun 13, 2009
    When it is about common knowledge, we should learn from others; when it is about life, we must learn by ourselves. Jun 12, 2009
    Outward knowledge is too often a facade to protect our inward emptiness. Jun 12, 2009
    When representation is too far from what is, neurosis develops. Jun 12, 2009
    A lot of us seem incapable of seeing what is. We generally prefer seeing what should be; this is why we suffer. Jun 12, 2009
    Why are we used to have the thoughts preceding action ? Jun 12, 2009
    The products of the will are never spontaneous. All thoughts are not the truth. Jun 11, 2009
