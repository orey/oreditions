# Water Flows


Religion is the voice of the heart, the voice of the truth.<br />
It is as simple as the water flowing in the fields in spring.

-

My Friend! The path is inside us with the help of the master!<br />
Don't search outwardly what is inside!

Oh Beloved! Everything in me is small,<br />
Negligible and pitiful except my love for You!

Who are the guides?<br />
The Prophet, the closed ones, the saints, the masters!<br />
But Beloved, when reflecting on our heart, Your light guides!

-

Beloved! Sometimes You destroy!<br />
Sometimes You create!<br />
Who I am to seek the meaning of it?

Wisdom will always be the less unpleasant thing to hear<br />
And it will always live because there will always be wisdom carriers

Don't learn wisdom in books!<br />
Learn wisdom from your heart!<br />
Polish it and let the Beloved shine on it!

The world is confusion!<br />
The outward world but unfortunately also the inward world!<br />
Only You, my Friend can bring me peace!<br />
Come back to me!
