# Teaching Equilibrium

Those who reflect You, Beloved<br />
Are annihilated!<br />
Those who speak the truth in silence<br />
Are walking into Your shadow!

Beloved, Your dance is the universe equilibrium!<br />
Beloved, You are here and far away!<br />
Beloved, You smile and are angry at the same time!

My Friend!<br />
You made us so limited!<br />
So small, so insignificant!<br />
Only our love for You can make us great!<br />
When we are Your truth and teachings

Teach to make others greater than you!<br />
You can teach because the Beloved taught you!<br />
Teach the love of the Beloved!<br />
The Heart of our heart!
