    Melting behavior and structure? Beark, i would have said with my UML formatted mind. But well, that's quite good to do that in a clean way. Aug 12, 2013
    Archimate is a good compromise. You can play with it without knowing and you can go deeper and deeper. Aug 12, 2013
    Lankhorst got me with his tricks. I'm becoming a fan of ArchiMate. Aug 12, 2013
    Archimate is enabling so many things I was doing off the record that I find it really great. And the more I use it, the more I like it. Aug 12, 2013
    For me there is a before Archimate and an after. Yeah, I'm in the after and that's good :) Aug 12, 2013
    Frankly, I did not find the limits of what I can do with Archimate. Well, yes. Business Object States. But I can manage it anyway. Aug 12, 2013
    It's been so long that I was not impressed by an IT novelty, but ArchiMate is good in so many cases! Aug 12, 2013
    Yes, I suffered so long with UML and all those points of view sharing a referential but not being coherent.., Archimate solved all that. Aug 12, 2013
    A good introduction to Archimate is the book: Enterprise Architecture At Work. I don't like ads but this books really rocks. Aug 12, 2013
    Ok, after two years of use, I admit it: Archimate is a breakthrough! Aug 12, 2013

    La moindre connaissance touchant les choses les plus hautes est plus désirable qu’une science très certaine des choses moindres. - Aristote. Jul 06, 2013
    Developers today are not bader then yesterday. But they need 5 or more technologies to work! Jul 06, 2013
    IT now is hard: -You need 3+ technologies to create a screen (HTML5/CSS3/JS). -Server side programming is opaque (MVC/ORM). Jul 06, 2013
    Developers should know what is the total price of ORM. Quite often: lack of freedom + difficulty of maintenance. But it's quick (and dirty). Jul 06, 2013
    Every ORM toolkit is pushing in a direction: rotting your object business model with relational concepts or rotting you DB with OO stuff. Jul 06, 2013
    You can do OO and SQL with the purity of the two worlds. But you have to adapt manually between them. Jul 06, 2013
    Most ORM frameworks push relational concepts into te business objects, which is pragmatic but not really OO. Jul 06, 2013
    I first worked on ORM in 1995 which makes me look like a dinausor. Nowadays, problems are the same. Jul 06, 2013
    MVC was marketed too heavily by Internet framework vendors. It is useful in RAD but is not easy to mix with ORM. Jul 06, 2013
    MVC is a GUI design pattern and not a software architecture pattern. -Unless you have SQL orders in the controllers. Jul 06, 2013

    Agile was born because too few IT guyz had invested on funtional analysis. Coding first seems more efficient. And it's not, for sure. Nov 22, 2012
    Agile work implies users availability which is often seen as user waste of time. Are we bound to confuse jobs? Nov 22, 2012
    Agile is a brand, a marketing concept. Who will claim not to be agile? Only dinausors. Nov 22, 2012
    Lots of managers expect IT guyz to deliver, whatever the delivery, whatever the quality. Meanwhile users are living in a construction site. Nov 22, 2012
    Agile misuse is criminal in companies because it justifies having no specs, no architecture, no design and no functional coherency. Nov 22, 2012
    It seems that designing applications is outdated. UML is forgotten or not known at all. Coding without thinking is creating horseshit. Nov 22, 2012

    I am always puzzled by the lack of reflection of bad managers. Their actions have no consequences and the fault is never theirs. Sep 14, 2012
    I just learnt that a marketing director recycled a 10 years-old bad idea. Some guyz are just doing the same on and on. Sep 14, 2012
    In some human contexts, you just can't explain how it is. People have to experiment it themselves. Sep 14, 2012
    Bad managers are so funny: they always think they are good ones and keep on criticizing those who aren't. Sep 14, 2012

    We need Windows 8 to make hardware evolve to touch screens for all PC users in all conditions. Just that the IT press doesn't understand. Aug 21, 2012
    Windows 8, despite all the bad talk we can read on medias, is a pragmatic solution: push for touch enabled hardware and support the legacy. Aug 21, 2012
    That would mean be blocked in the hierarchy... Possibly. We'll see. I don't loose the hope of meeting more project oriented guyz. Aug 21, 2012

    You don't develop something for the beauty of the code (even though I like beautiful code), you work for the user. Mar 19, 2010
    The first IT preoccupation should be the user; the second should be the user; and the third should be the user. Mar 19, 2010

    @mlevison Sure. The problem with Agile is not the method itself, but the way the top level mgt understands it - like black magic! Mar 14, 2010
    Principle #9: When a requirement is not mature, developers should never hear about it (except in software companies). Mar 14, 2010
    Principle #8: When projects are not producing developer understandable documentation, you should think about creating product mgr function. Mar 14, 2010
    IT PM is the key function that concentrates lots of requirements coming from lots of projects into a release plan. Mar 14, 2010
    Principle #7: A release plan for an application is -1. not a democratic process -2. the responsibility of the IT PM of the application. Mar 14, 2010
    IT PM are doing the transformation between vertical project views and application releases. This is a core function of CMMI build process. Mar 14, 2010
    Principle #6: if your project management sucks, ask yourself if someone is in charge of the application from front office to accounting. Mar 14, 2010
    IT PM is a great job, a natural evolution for developers liking communication and functional perspective. Mar 14, 2010
    IT product managers must understand the application they are in charge with requires sometimes some technical refresh. Mar 14, 2010
    The IT PM is the doll or guy that says 'me' when you ask 'who's responsible for this f**king application?' Mar 14, 2010
    Lots of companies try to solve project management issues by methods whereas lots of issues can only be coped with by IT product managers. Mar 14, 2010
    Real IT product management requires a deep IT understanding + an exhaustive functional coverage from front end to accounting (TP & batch). Mar 14, 2010
    Real IT product management is a complex but crucial job in companies that are producing software internally, not only in software editors. Mar 14, 2010
    Antipattern: providing a developer with user requirements. That is why the product management did enter the IT world. Mar 14, 2010
    The lottery IT business is at least 10 years late compared to big banks or airlines IT, even if it shares most of the constraints. Mar 14, 2010
    Principle #5: before thinking in 'tiers', try to figure out what it really is. Mar 13, 2010
    In some disciplines, Europe is the countryside of the US. In others, it is the reverse. Mar 13, 2010
    France is a great engineering country but a poor software industry. Perhaps a matter of universities and company perception. Mar 13, 2010
    In France, old techies are considered failures. It has always been trendier to be an IT project manager with absolutely no IT knowledge, Mar 13, 2010
    Principle #4: client side development expertise does not imply server side expertise. Transactional systems are not written in JavaScript. Mar 13, 2010
    Principle #3: client protocol stack reacts very badly in a high traffic gateway. Don't reuse code when it is obviously silly. Mar 13, 2010
    Principle #2: never assume the server will know the IP addresses of all the clients. Don't build an architecture on that principle. Mar 13, 2010
    Principle #1: some services are UI services and some services are central services. Technology for both kinds may not be the same. Mar 13, 2010
    In IT, you need principles based on realism. Let's do some list. Mar 13, 2010

    Oracle BI? This is the datamining Grail: just enter your data and look at reports! It it could be as simple as that! Mar 13, 2010
    What people forget in Agile is that it works much better with experienced and skilled developers. Mar 13, 2010

    @Travel_Tripper: RezTrip 2.0 is coming with a new transactional platform. Follow those guyz. They gonna blow up the Hotel IT business! Mar 02, 2010
    A good training for IT project managers: second level support. A good training for developers: work a week with the soft they built. Mar 02, 2010
    Corporates that master a proper escalation process have a real competitive advantage. Provided the message is not lost in translation. Mar 02, 2010
    Denial, in IT as in the rest of business, is costing billions of dollars. This is silly because we are all paid to raise or solve issues. Mar 02, 2010
    There are several forms of denial, one of which is the denial 'by doing something else'. You deny just by acting not to see the problem. Mar 02, 2010
    Denial in business is awkward because denying an issue will not solve it which means that this issue will get worse with time. Mar 02, 2010
    Good business is based on pragmatism which is relying on the opposite of the denial behavior: facing the facts and act upon them. Mar 02, 2010
    Saving millions by going out of outsourcing deals? http://bit.ly/adzLBY Mar 02, 2010
    One of the most puzzling business behavior that seems to be trendy those days is reality and truth denial. This is awkward to me. Mar 01, 2010
    On the other way round, if your system is not reaching several thousands of tps, you can think about keeping (well designed) SQL. Mar 01, 2010
    When your system must process more than several thousands of tps, you should ask yourself if SQL is still adapted to your business. Mar 01, 2010
    Twitter abandons MySQL for a non SQL database: http://bit.ly/9JrcDy (in French). This is the life of high volume transactional systems! Mar 01, 2010
    Let's talk about web services: how many developers cannot make the difference between a web service and XML serialization? Mar 01, 2010
    In IT, too many people use the wrong denomination to name some software pieces. This confusion aims only to sell what they have. Mar 01, 2010
    Lotteries crave for a third IT player in the game because their choice is too limited. Feb 28, 2010
    Scalability is not compatible with Agile. Except if you have reliable senior developers, which is often not the case. Feb 23, 2010
    Agile is clearly not adapted to all sorts of projects. Warning to a new kind of tunnel project: the endless delivery of prototypes. Feb 23, 2010
    One motto for a development manager: 'above all, don't develop before showing me the design'. Once it is done, you will want to reuse. Feb 23, 2010
    Developers should develop less and think more before developing. Feb 23, 2010
    Anticipation is a great asset for IT companies. But many people never estimate the cost of failed anticipation in money and motivation. Feb 23, 2010
    Internal IT must sell itself to the CEO to counter the blindness hunger of low upfront costs myths fans to offshore. Feb 22, 2010
    IT teams can be great but in nowaday's life, IT teams must learn how to report. Feb 22, 2010
    IT around online selling is garbage-able. Provided you put your critical functions over non web layers. Gosh, who said 'mainframe'? Feb 21, 2010
    Online selling is not only an IT Internet technology based business, but it is also a real matter of intermediation. Feb 21, 2010
    Warning for companies selling on the net: manage your B2B costs in order not to grant free services to your resellers. Feb 21, 2010
    It is not a matter of choice; when you are selling products over the net, you have to cope with both B2C and B2B models. Feb 21, 2010
    Internet business makes some providers face the issue of dis-intermediation. While they were always in a B2B model, they face a B2C market. Feb 21, 2010
    When you want your business to survive on the Internet, the least you can do is doing exactly what you did before - but on the Internet! Feb 21, 2010
    A great Internet business move in the music domain: Naxos ! http://bit.ly/a3OyUx Feb 21, 2010
    A bad Internet business move: French publishers. When their internal talks are over, Google will have occupied the full market. Feb 21, 2010
    Most companies face real problems extrapolating their business model over the Internet. That lets some space for new born competitors. Feb 21, 2010
    I always said that due to severe design issues, Google Wave had no future at least as it is. So here comes Google Buzz... Feb 15, 2010
    The two big risks of IT are 1. reinventing what already exists 2. reuse what is not adapted to your business requirements. Feb 09, 2010
    Power motivated people should realize that some people are challenge oriented or affiliation oriented to begin to think out of 'their' box. Feb 07, 2010
    Every kind of motivation is required in a company, to be begin with 'challenge oriented' people to achieve projects. Feb 07, 2010
    It is useful to analyse what are our thoughts in a day: are they recycling vainly a small amount of IT concepts and markeying names? Feb 07, 2010
    Truth, in companies, always ends up to be known. IT is no exception. Jan 30, 2010
    AI did not progress with time because the simple copy of nature elements is not research but blind stupid faith. Jan 30, 2010
    GUI world is changing very fast while mainframe world is solid rock. Jan 30, 2010
    Transactional business leads to specific designs, i.e. not all architectures are scalable. This is obvious but not so known. Jan 30, 2010
    Difficult balance between business and IT: too much IT leads to bad business deliveries; too many deliveries lead to bad system design. Jan 27, 2010
    Frequently the software is designed the same strange way the organization is. Jan 27, 2010
    There is no technical problem, but there are so many person problems, as if the software was the result of interpersonal conflicts. Jan 27, 2010
    IT is one of the only businesses where people who know very little can appear as gurus to the CEO level guys. Beware of the consequences! Jan 27, 2010
    IT re-organization must not try to compensate inter-human issues or lack of strategy. And indeed, it often does. Jan 27, 2010
    Is Twitter the reflection of the global consciousness? Probably considering the same things are thought by everyone synchroneously. Jan 25, 2010
    For companies that are selling a lot through lots of channels, common CRM off the shelf products are no competitive advantage at all. Jan 24, 2010
    If you try to do a 5 years business case on an ERP, except for HR and financials, you will discover you should develop internally. Jan 24, 2010
    With ERPs, you know what you buy but did you really measure what you loose? Jan 24, 2010
    ERPs may be said generic: their drawbacks are not be adapted to some business rules of yours. Jan 24, 2010
    Beware to the CEO level IT consultans! They are driven by trends and can endanger your business. Jan 24, 2010
    IT is one of the only engineering businesses where people who don't master the subject can provide pieces of advice. Jan 24, 2010
    For the new Year: I wish you all a year full of IT projects, UML native speaking users, understanding developers and honest IT providers :-) Jan 23, 2010
    Beware of IT marketing guys: they can try to convince you that the error you did is new, because the technology is. Which is always untrue. Jan 22, 2010
    I love IT - but I dislike a lot making the same mistake twice. Jan 22, 2010
    Good testing implies development. Jan 22, 2010
    Sharing of experience sample: Do not construct a static C++ object with another static C++ object... This is noooot predictable. Jan 22, 2010
    People repeat too many things on twitter instead of thinking by themselves or sharing a 140 chars experience. Jan 22, 2010
    A batch is well designed if I can run it in less than 30s on my netbook. Unless you manipulate more than 10^12 business entities... Jan 22, 2010
    Principle never to forget: for the same transaction, you don't design it the same way if you have 10 tps, 100 tps or 1000 tps. Jan 22, 2010
    Some people should learn all application cannot scale horizontally. Jan 22, 2010
    I don't like python because too many things are not expressed. python is a dirty programming language for dirty developers :-) Jan 22, 2010
    Let's be frank: javascript is not serious. Nor is the generation of javascript which is... an industrialized workaround! Jan 22, 2010
    So many people think they are IT genius because they developed a php website! Jan 22, 2010
    A project management antipattern: Never accept a former IT salesman to lead an IT project of yours. Jan 22, 2010
    The brain of the marketing people cannot digest IT stuff no more than a developer can digest a business requirement. Jan 22, 2010
    A piece of advice : never feed a developer with a business requirement, it will end up with a complete mess! Jan 22, 2010
    Functional analysis is one of the core problems of IT organizations. I have been explaining that for 15 years. Jan 22, 2010
    The IT pain of most IT organization ? Never defined clearly who was in charge of UML use cases formalization and UML functional analysis. Jan 22, 2010
    Complex project management pushes for creating some transverse activities : technical architecture but also functional coherency teams. Jan 22, 2010
    As projects become more complex to manage (several teams in several sites), project managers know less functional and technical stuff. Jan 22, 2010
    With web technologies, in 5 to 10 years, we will face the ``spaguetti code'' world war II, the proof that we did not progress a lot. Jan 22, 2010
    Today's developers seem less trained or even less interested than 15 years ago. But this could be due to passing web technologies. Jan 22, 2010
    Technology must never overcome the reason to use it. Jan 22, 2010
    People are mad from technology but, really, technology in IT did not invent much things for the last 30 years. Jan 22, 2010
    Expertise can be good in IT provided it doesn't last too long. If an expert doesn't widen his area of interest, expertise will be paralysis. Jan 22, 2010
    Lots of companies live without willing to see what is going on outside. This explains internal over and under self estimation. Jan 22, 2010
    IT is some kind of 'esoteric' science. People knowing few things will have their ego infatuated; people knowing a lot can be invisible. Dec 09, 2009
    IT is a memory-less business: you will be able to sell tomorrow the exact same concept that you sold today - but with different terms. Dec 09, 2009
    The danger of IT is to turn every technical achievement into an ideology. Dec 09, 2009
    The ultimate Swiss knife for desperate developers: http://bit.ly/5HuE8v Dec 07, 2009
    When requirements are mature, the IT guys can propose great evolutions of the business through the extendibility of the applications. Dec 02, 2009
    In IT, we can measure 'business maturity'. This indicator is directly link to the quality and coherence of requirements. Dec 02, 2009
    Typical responsible project management: if you want me to develop that your way, I won't sign any SLA; but I am OK to rediscuss needs. Dec 01, 2009
    Despite the multiplicity of IT systems and technologies, basic principles of IT never changed for 30 years. Dec 01, 2009
    There are two ways to lead a project: do as your customer wants even if it requirements are silly; guarantee the solution and get involved. Dec 01, 2009
    Latin people have a certain affective way of dealing with IT problems. This leads very often to absurd situations. Dec 01, 2009
    RT @codepo8: I am sure that xml namespaces are the work of beelzebub himself. Dec 01, 2009
    In #IT, the most difficult task is to gather and contain #requirements. The users or their representatives must never design a solution. Dec 01, 2009
    #Scrum in two words: 'Yes' for avoiding the long projects tunnel effect; 'No' to enter the branded #micro #functionality era. Nov 25, 2009
    Except that Lycos Java chat rooms were running very fast compared to the improbable HTML 5 Google Wave monster running XMPP! Nov 25, 2009
    #Google #Wave reminds me of the ancient #Lycos #Java 1.0 applet based chat rooms at the beginning of the Internet: numerous useless talks. Nov 25, 2009
    Is #Chrome OS one more #Google #buzz? Remember that Google is an #advertisement company and earn #money when we all talk about them. Nov 25, 2009
    By the way, Google developers are developing under Chrome OS? ;-) Nov 25, 2009
    Really, Chrome OS is not serious. An operating system is more than Chrome browser and its use are multiple. Nov 25, 2009
    I was surprised years ago when branded #micro #functionality appeared. Before, people were making a #release and now we only get fragments. Nov 25, 2009
    It doesn't seem reasonable to think you can sell an OS with applications running on HTML 5. Remember that this is why the PC appeared. Nov 24, 2009
    RT @kasthomas: LiveJournal's Back End: A History of Scaling http://3.ly/6Zh Nov 24, 2009
    #Google would be good at operating system development? Let us see how Google Wave will scale with such a silly architecture! EGO-OGLE, no? Nov 23, 2009
    Chrome OS is targeting people that only live online with poor HTML 5 applications. I'll keep my autonomous free Linux, thanks! #Google Nov 23, 2009
    RT @Enderle: A look at Google and their bad interviewing practices and how they can eventually kill a company. http://bit.ly/tQSAm Nov 21, 2009
    We begin to read stories about Google censorship. This is a usual fact when companies grow big. IBM and Microsoft did that also. Nov 21, 2009
    IT is a young world that recycle concepts quickly. But even if it appears as novelty though marketing, it is always the same concepts. Nov 21, 2009
    Reusability can be one good thing as it can be one of the worst thing in IT. Nov 21, 2009
