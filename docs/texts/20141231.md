# The Jewel

Islam has no hierarchy, except a spiritual one.<br />
That makes it eternal and immortal.<br />
Because anyone can be the heir of the Prophet (pbuh)!

Islam is, in a way, the substance of monotheism.<br />
With no central power to corrupt,<br />
Its corruption can be legitimately fought from the inside.

Islam is a jewel:<br />
It is accessible to mankind,<br />
It is abstract but concrete in love,<br />
It is tolerant,<br />
It is self controlling.<br />
Thanks my Friend

Ho Beloved!<br />
You feed so many of us by Your presence and Your strength!<br />
Let us come on Your path while imperfects!

My Friend! You are still there for the ones that have a place for You in their hearts!

On this night,<br />
I pray for all the poor children that are hungry and afraid and alone!<br />
My dearest Friend!<br />
Comfort them!
