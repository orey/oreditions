# Cleansing Our Self

There is a belief in Western countries<br />
That history is finished.<br />
That is a very wrong assertion.<br />
History goes where You lead it, my Friend.

Ideologies weaken the mind<br />
And bring it to the land of the confused.<br />
Cleanse yourself from ideologies and preconceived ideas.

When You are here, Beloved,<br />
I cannot be upset with anything because I is no more here!

My Friend,<br />
Protect the children,<br />
The weak and the true hearts who suffer.<br />
Be with them in their hard times and ease their pain.

*(Al-Zeituni, June 2014)*
