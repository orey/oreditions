# What Remains of Wise Men?

My Lord<br />
I follow the traces of Your steps!<br />
I seek for Your perfume!<br />
I laugh with the echos of your laughter in the eyes of children!

What will remain of us?<br />
Ashes!<br />
What remains of wise men?<br />
Their words of prayer<br />
My Lord, when we speak with You, we create drops of eternity!

In all the forgettable words pronounced by us<br />
Please Beloved<br />
Keep the ones that speak about You!
