# How Could I?

We keep searching something to entertain us<br />
You laugh at us, my Friend, before your childish children<br />
While Your breath feeds the believers!

Technology, comfort, pleasure<br />
Consuming as sole horizon<br />
Is this what we became, my Lord?<br />
Pour some more wine in my soul<br />
For I pray you again

Times change, Beloved!<br />
The surface of things does<br />
Like ripples on the lake<br />
However<br />
Times don't change<br />
The truth is still the same!<br />
Beloved!

How could I<br />
Teach<br />
Me that I am worse than the worst of men!<br />
How could I<br />
Pray<br />
When I am a sinner deep within<br />
Come Beloved!<br />
And forgive me!

Your love is so large!<br />
Your mercy is so huge!<br />
Your breath makes so many hearts beat!<br />
You hide in such unexpected places!<br />
Oh such happiness!

While You're there dearest friend<br />
Everything cease to pretend existing!<br />
The world bows in front of such strength,<br />
Such life, love and truth!

Love is in the eyes of my tree!<br />
It sings the glory of the Lord!<br />
Love is the heart of my heart!<br />
Bleeding for Your crushing presence!

Beloved! You are the master!<br />
Everything is a bridge to You!<br />
Every experience, every feeling!<br />
All that small moments that have a taste of You
