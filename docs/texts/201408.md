# Waiting For Your Light

Sometimes<br />
I can do nothing<br />
But to wait<br />
For your light

-

Beloved!<br />
Your inspirations are like lava!<br />
I can't keep them in my hands!<br />
And no memory can keep them as they were!

-

The murid in the long path follows many great men's steps!

-

Attachment leads to bad feelings<br />
For it's a movement from the world to the ego!<br />
Love!<br />
Love erases the ego in his movement towards the world!

-

The second suspends!<br />
You are there my Friend!<br />
Pour me some more wine!<br />
For me to get of the ego!<br />
And take some veils out of<br />
The Bride face!

I wish I could be a thousand!<br />
To help the others like saints do!<br />
But I am a mediocre man!<br />
In misery when You're not there!

I have no face!<br />
No name, no age, no memory, Beloved!<br />
I doesn't mean anything anymore!<br />
Keep me close!

When something's marvelous,<br />
There's a short bridge to your truth.
