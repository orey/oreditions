#The Imbalance Fixer

When ideology enters in religion, things are perverted.<br />
In a way, all forms of intellectual Gnosticism are ideology.

My Lord!<br />
You correct the imbalance!<br />
You are near from Your servants!<br />
You speak to us through the Quran!<br />
You forgive us,<br />
How small we can be!

The heart of my heart is one drop of Your sea!<br />
The breath of my breath is my deepest prayer for You!<br />
The memory of Your touch is my secret!

In my eyes is the light of You, Beloved!<br />
In that light is a path to Your kingdom!<br />
Each time You are near, I eclipse!<br />
Touched by Your mercy!

My faith is not faith but heart!<br />
My heart is not heart but faith!<br />
The heart of my heart remembers You!<br />
As You make the worlds dance!
