# As It Is Supposed To be

My Friend<br />
You are always there making us feel and understand<br />
That all is as it is supposed to be!

Dear Lord, when You come close<br />
I am blind, deaf, touch-less, speechless!<br />
Your shadow is so overwhelming!<br />
My heart is burnt by Your breath!

Islam is in my heart!<br />
In the heart of Islam are paths to You, Whirling Lord!<br />
At the heart of my heart is the mark of Your touch!

Intellect is great!<br />
Intellect is matter!<br />
Intellect is illusion!<br />
Only Your light opens our eyes<br />
And feed our soul!

When You are near from us<br />
We melt like ice under the July sun!<br />
When You are near from us<br />
We shine reflecting flows from Your eternal source!

*(Al-Zeituni, August 2016)*
