# In The Eye Of A Child

Oh my Friend!<br />
So many people would like us to react, to judge, to be against!<br />
They should look at You!<br />
Because You speak to their hearts!

Oh my Friend!<br />
You play with us!<br />
Indeed You play with our egos, putting egos against egos in a sterile confrontation!<br />
All of us! Repent!

In the heart of the night,<br />
Bats are flying chanting Your equilibrium,<br />
And I am contemplating Your unseeable veils!

In the eye of a child,<br />
I see Your shadow, my Lord!<br />
In the eye of a dog,<br />
I see my eye crushed to ashes by love for my Master!

*(Al-Zeituni, June 2016)*
